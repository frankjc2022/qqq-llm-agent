Could this new tech help breathe new life into Apple shares? TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Market Domination to discuss Apple's upcoming tech event, what it means for the tech giant in its future quarters and into 2025, and whether an iPhone upgrade cycle can reinvigorate the stock. "I think this will do okay. People are not excited anymore about iPhone upgrades for the most part because they all look the same, and they're pretty similar. It's hard to tell recent generations apart and eventually, I think, Apple will eventually do a foldable [phone] as we've seen with Samsung (005930.KS) and with Google (GOOG, GOOGL)," O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance. "But, in the meantime, I think they'll do okay. But that focus again is going to be on the software much more than the hardware this time around."

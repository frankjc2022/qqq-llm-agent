Arctic Wolf has released its new Human Risk Report today, which analyzes some of the top cybersecurity risks facing companies. Nick Schneider, Arctic Wolf president and CEO, calls the election "an event that sparks a lot of interest from bad actors." He explains, "I think during an election year or any time there's an event that has significant interest in the public sphere, you're going to get increased interest and increased activity from the bad actors, both against businesses, but also against individuals, and kind of where those two meet or intersect is also additional risk to individual organizations." BJ Schaknowski, CEO of symplr, discusses the state of the healthcare industry as AI becomes increasingly adopted. Schaknowski explains that symplr is helping hospitals become more productive by helping with tasks associated with compliance, quality, and safety. He notes these tasks have been "wildly fragmented" in hospitals, working "against the productivity of critical healthcare workers who should be providing care, not sitting in front of a laptop, inputting data." Schaknowski notes that nurses spend about three to five hours a day in front of a computer screen when they instead can be focused on mentoring newer nurses and spending more time caring for patients. Yahoo Finance Data and Markets Editor Jared Blikre breaks down some of his biggest takeaways from the trading day as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed at a record high and the volatility index (^VIX) is down just below 20. Big Tech's CapEx spending on AI is on the path higher into the last quarter of 2024. Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman examines hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms' (META) investments into generative AI and data centers, putting more fuel into Nvidia's (NVDA) figurative AI chip fire. Finally, Josh Lipton checks on some of the stocks moving most in after-hours trading: Lucid (LCID), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and Alcoa (AA).

But how can investors gain exposure to these megacap tech names without buying individual stocks? Calamos Investments senior vice president and head of ETFs Matt Kaufman joins Yahoo Finance to discuss investing strategies. Kaufman points out that the Magnificent Seven trade continues to drive strong market returns, with the group up 40% this year. He notes, "The Mag Seven is still accounting for a significant portion" of market gains, even as the other 493 S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies are starting to gain momentum. "If the leadership in the Mag 7 stops continuing going forward, maybe the innovation doesn't keep up at the same pace, then you would want exposure to those other names as well," Kaufman advises. He suggests investors consider CANQ (CANQ), an ETF that provides exposure to top names using options to remain defensive. "We're seeing a lot of folks moving into this options-based strategy, which really allows you to control the exposure you want to these Mag 7 names and to others," Kaufman explains.

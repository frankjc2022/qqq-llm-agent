Quickplay Co-Founder and Chief Business Officer Paul Pastor joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the implications of this partnership for the evolving streaming landscape. Pastor emphasizes that it is an "unbelievable time" to be a part of the media industry, given the tremendous amount of change underway. Drawing on his experience dating back to when cable was emerging, Pastor notes that streaming is now "the topic du jour." Regarding the MrBeast deal, Pastor explains that projects with "stars attached" to them in Hollywood tend to reduce risk and boost engagement, stressing that the Amazon-MrBeast collaboration is a "tried and true" model. However, he highlights that this deal also opens the door for other content creators on YouTube to "build out incredible franchises" beyond just the YouTube platform itself— which will benefit both the influencer class and the production companies involved.

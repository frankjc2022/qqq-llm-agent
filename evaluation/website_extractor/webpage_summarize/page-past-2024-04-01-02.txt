Nvidia (NVDA) is highlighted as a significant player in the AI sector, but analysts suggest that its growth may not match the previous year's performance due to its size.

Additionally, Microsoft is restructuring its Teams application amid EU antitrust scrutiny, indicating a strategic shift in its business model.

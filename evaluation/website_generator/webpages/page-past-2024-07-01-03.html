Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte is favoring Amazon in the next chapter of the AI race and broader Big Tech growth. "I think there's an opportunity that their [Amazon] health care initiatives can help them hit the $3 trillion mark. More likely it'll be... advertising, e-commerce, cloud computing growth," Forte tells Market Domination. "I think they're very early stage in their efforts. But I do think there's a potential, given that it's a huge total addressable market [TAM] and maybe one that's potentially ripe for disruption..." Forte also comments on Apple's own AI initiatives and whether Amazon investors should view regulatory crackdowns as "just noise."

The latest news highlights significant developments in major tech companies, particularly Tesla (TSLA) and Meta Platforms (META). 

In Tesla's case, a Delaware judge is expected to rule on Elon Musk's controversial $56 billion pay package by the end of the year. This package, initially voided by the court, is the largest in corporate history. Meanwhile, Tesla's stock performance has been mixed, with analysts noting fluctuations in investor confidence and market reactions to recent product announcements, such as the Cybercab robotaxi.

Meta Platforms has also been in the spotlight, reporting strong third-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations. Despite this, the stock has faced pressure due to broader market concerns, particularly regarding capital expenditures related to artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts suggest that while Meta's AI investments are yielding positive results, there are fears about the sustainability of the AI boom and its impact on future spending.

Additionally, the tech sector is experiencing a broader market downturn, with the S&P 500 ending its monthly winning streak. Analysts are closely monitoring upcoming events, including elections and Federal Reserve meetings, which could influence market dynamics. 

Overall, both Tesla and Meta are navigating complex challenges, balancing strong performance metrics with investor apprehensions about future growth and spending in an evolving tech landscape.

The blue-chip index gave up an early gain and posted its largest slide since August after Fed officials lowered rates by a quarter percentage point and disappointed investors by signaling just two more cuts next year.  Investors’ expectation for lower rates ahead was among the factors that powered stocks to records in recent weeks, with the Dow industrials hitting an all-time high above 45000 earlier in December.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Nvidia stock rebounds amid bullish analyst outlooks, then falters after Fed decision</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-12-18 21:14:23+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Nvidia stock rose as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that AI chip demand could wane.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Amazon Stock Is a 2025 ‘Best Idea’ for Several Analysts.

While the narrow leadership has raised some concerns about concentration and broadening trading themes, Baird Investment strategist Ross Mayfield tells Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Morning Brief that these worries may be overblown. "It's certainly something we keep an eye on, but I would say that if you had been worried about that concentration or used it as a reason to get out of the market at any point over the last couple of years, it would have been a mistake," Mayfield says. The strategist believes investors "should be celebrating that some of the biggest and most innovative companies are in our markets. Concentration risk, or heavy concentration, has not been a good forward indicator over the last 40 or 50 years based on the data that we've seen." "It's something to keep an eye on [as] it maybe makes the market a little bit more fragile to something like Nvidia having a bad stretch run, but it's not something that we worry about too much," Mayfield adds.

Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon joins Market Domination to discuss the growing divide. Goujon highlights recent policy initiatives like the Routers Act and the US Commerce Department's ICTS (Information and Communications Technology and Services) controls, which aim to remove Chinese components from infrastructure due to increased data and cybersecurity concerns. She notes that companies like TP-Link have become deeply embedded in US infrastructure, making this a complex challenge. "What the US is doing is it's saying that 'look, there's a number of toolmakers out there that still want to feed into the Chinese chip market,'" Goujon explains. She describes a new "single chip de minimis" provision that would extend US restrictions to any factory worldwide using even one US chip. "So the US is basically telling partners 'do the right thing, align with us or else you're going to be subject to US law and compliance.'" However, Goujon cautions that the immediate impact may be limited: "The issue is that China has been able to stockpile an enormous amount of equipment, especially over the past one and a half years... and so it may take a while to even see the effects of export controls biting."

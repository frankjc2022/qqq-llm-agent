The strategist says not only does the Magnificent Seven group, made up of Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL), has more room to run in 2025, the stocks could actually function as a defensive play amid market uncertainty. "We're thinking the Mag Seven actually unfold as a quasi staple," Chronert says, explaining, "Usually you go to [consumer] staples when you have uncertain economic conditions because of the persistence of earnings growth." "The Mag Seven, we think, that forward-looking earnings growth for certainly for [2025] and probably into [2026] is fairly visible. So all told, when you get concerned about other things at work in the market and the economy, the Mag Seven actually have this potential to be a quote, defensive if you will." The strategist highlights the phrase "growth is defensive," saying, "That's what's going on here." He notes, "These companies probably can't just live on meeting expectations. They need to continue to meet beat and then probably raise forward expectations as well" to maintain their "defensive" status.

Notable figures include Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, and SoftBank (9434.T, 9984.T) CEO Masayoshi Son. The Verge senior policy reporter Lauren Feiner joined Catalysts to discuss this shift in attitude compared to Trump's first term. "I think tech CEOs are taking a very different approach this time around when it comes to the Trump administration," Feiner noted, highlighting "a lot less resistance" and more "openness" to working with the president-elect. "We're seeing a recognition from the tech industry that there's a lot on the line in terms of policies and lawsuits and they want to be on the right side of the administration going into things," she told Yahoo Finance. Regarding AI initiatives, Feiner believes the landscape will be more favorable under Trump, particularly with tech billionaire Elon Musk taking a vocal stance in the administration. However, she cautioned that the broader tech industry's sentiment remains uncertain, describing Musk's involvement as "a big wildcard."

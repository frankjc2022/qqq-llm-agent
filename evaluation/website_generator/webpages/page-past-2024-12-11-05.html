"People don't want to be on the wrong side of what has been, for two years, an incredibly impressive trade," he tells Yahoo Finance. Investors are returning to the Magnificent 7 names because these stocks provide both offensive and defensive strategies in the current market landscape. "These companies as a whole... really have impressive operating leverage," Mazza notes. With uncertainty surrounding potential tariffs and inflation in the upcoming year, investors are seeking companies that can "power through" economic challenges, which increasingly points them toward the Magnificent Seven. Despite this focus, Mazza adds: "I think there is a general sentiment that the economy is okay, and we have so much positive investor sentiment right now, and that to me is what's really pushing the market higher."

The update comes after Google unveiled a new quantum computing chip, Willow, which sent the stock higher. Seaport Research Partners senior analyst Aaron Kessler joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to break down the news and the stock move. "I think it shows that Google continues to be the leader in AI services. Obviously, Google's been investing in AI for several years now, and it was one of the early leaders. Obviously, I think there was concern with OpenAI maybe jumping Google in terms of ChatGPT, but I think Google's had a nice rebound here with tools like Gemini." The analyst says "it's probably a few things" driving the stock to record highs, including Gemini 2.0. and the quantum computing chip announcment, as well as General Motors (GM) shutting down its robotaxi unit, eliminating a possible competitor to Alphabet-owned Waymo. He adds, "Maybe investors are saying with the new administration coming in less likely, maybe, we see some DOJ action in terms of really splitting up Google and Chrome, which we think is pretty unlikely."

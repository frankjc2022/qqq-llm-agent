Investors are all but certain the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting on Wednesday. But the question of by how much — 25 or 50 basis points — has been hotly debated. Wall Street Journal Chief Economics Commentator and Deputy Economics Editor Greg Ip lays out the case for a half-point cut, explaining, "It all starts out by looking at where rates are now," Ip says, noting that the current target rate of 5.25%-5.50% is the highest in 20 years. Rates were initially pushed that high because of sticky, elevated inflation. But in recent months, inflation has cooled considerably. The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) closed Monday mixed after disappointing iPhone 16 pre-order numbers caused Apple (AAPL) to slip and pull the Nasdaq down along with it. Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jared Blikre analyzes the day’s top market movements, including the surge in cyclical sectors such as utilities (XLU), the weight of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later this week, and September's seasonality trends. TikTok spent Monday in court in the first day of its trial arguing against the US bill that could see the popular social media app banned in the United States if parent company ByteDance doesn't sell the platform to a non-Chinese entity. Axios Business Editor Dan Primack explains that the judge in the case was "fairly skeptical of TikTok's arguments," adding, "But what's important to note is the President of the United States does not have to ban it if there's not a divestiture, it gives the president the option to ban it. You've already got Donald Trump saying he would not ban TikTok." Intel (INTC) and Amazon (AMZN) Web Services announced a co-investment in custom chip designs in a multibillion, multi-year strategic collaboration. Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Baron explains that Intel has won a large customer in AWS, saying, "there's positive momentum there in terms of getting foundry wins." He believes that Intel is ultimately setting the stage to split into two companies: Intel and an Intel foundry. He believes that having an Intel Foundry subsidiary is "essentially as close as you can get to putting the right kind of walls and guardrails around Intel Foundry so that other customers can come in and feel comfortable knowing that they'll have capacity wafer allocation."

First-weekend preorder sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated to be about 13% lower than the iPhone 15. Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Market Domination to discuss the news and whether Apple will see a significant upgrade cycle. "I think the challenge for Apple, as reflected in those reports, is that they're trying to get a consumer to buy new hardware, which is coming out in the month of September. But the best-selling point for that hardware, especially for consumers in the US — Apple Intelligence, the AI-related features — those aren't coming out until beta next month," Forte tells Yahoo Finance. "And then it's more challenging for sales in Europe and China, where the AI-related features are coming next year, perhaps later. So I think that I'm not surprised that you're seeing a slow start for the 16 lineup on this gap between the hardware and the software." He argues that the iPhone 16 will have an upgrade cycle for AI, but it will likely be half the size of the upgrade cycle for 5G. While millions of consumers have iPhones that are at least three years old, Forte notes that a lot of the hardware updates, like processor speed and camera improvements, haven't "necessarily pushed the needle on an incremental amount of consumers upgrading their Apple device." He believes that the AI upgrade cycle will "take time," and adds, "it isn't helping the company that there's this gap between the hardware and the software." However, he does see consumer interest in AI-enabled smartphones. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

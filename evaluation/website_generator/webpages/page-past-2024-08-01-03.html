Citizens JMP equity research analyst Nick Jones joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into Amazon's earnings and how the company may operate moving forward. Jones points out that AWS "outperformed" so the disappointing Q3 guidance was "a little bit of a surprise." He continues pointing out what investors can look forward to: "Amazon still got global expansion opportunities. They continuously want to deliver things faster and faster. It's a really unique company too when you think about their advertising opportunity in combination with the retail," adding that though the company is "massive" it is "still very much in growth mode."

Will this trend continue or will chip stocks rebound even higher? Harvest Portfolio Management Co-CIO Paul Meeks joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on tech amid this earnings season. Meeks describes the current earnings season as "weird and squirrelly," stating he is refraining from buying tech names until the season concludes. He notes that while some companies are posting strong results, "their stocks go down the next day," leading him to characterize it as "too difficult of a market." Regarding tech names, Meeks observes that this earnings season, "The only thing that was not controversial at all is how much... money they're going to spend on AI CapEx [capital expenditures]." He believes this "bodes incredibly well" for companies like Nvidia (NVDA), saying the semiconductor giant will "have a hold on this market as far as the eye can see."

Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Asking For A Trade to give insight into the tech sector, the AI trade, and what it means for Big Tech moving forward into the earnings season. Moorhead reiterates his thought from a previous interview: "I really laid out a thesis that says the infrastructure build-out is going to continue for at least another year and maybe 18 months, and that's driven primarily by the downstream FOMO, or the fear of missing out, from those enterprise SaaS providers. Meta, who clearly showed that they're investing hardcore because they have to. If you are not investing in your competitors, you could be set back potentially a decade here. Moorhead is also looking at the long-term valuations of AI-adjacent software companies and chip designers like ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARM) He ends with his thoughts that Nvidia (NVDA) has "at least another 12 months to run. We saw TSMC (TSM), where Nvidia does all of their manufacturing, they're basically sold out through 2025 and into 2026. We just heard from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta that that they're putting the pedal to the metal on this. And all of this is goodness for Nvidia."

It was the dollar's breach of 160 yen that appears to have snapped the Ministry of Finance's patience.  The yen's rebound was perhaps exaggerated because Japan was closed for a public holiday on Monday - the dollar fell as low as 154.50 yen - so market liquidity will return to more normal levels on Tuesday.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Why Baidu Stock Jumped Today</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-04-29 21:26:09+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>It's getting difficult not to notice how impressive its driving and mapping tech has become.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Tesla short sellers get burned, econ data: Market takeaways</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-04-29 21:22:56+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>A slew of economic catalysts, including jobs data, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, and Big Tech earnings may accelerate markets this week. Notably, Treasury yields have lowered recently, with some experts pointing out this may be in anticipation of Powell's press conference. One of Monday's top trending tickers has been Tesla (TSLA), which saw a turnaround in its share price after CEO Elon Musk's surprise visit to China led to the tentative approval of the automaker's "Full Self-Driving" (FSD) software in China. With shares bouncing back, short sellers have taken a hit.

Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) have spent a lot of money on ramping up their AI offerings, but only one has a stock you may want to consider for your portfolio, according to Visible Alpha Head of TMT Research Melissa Otto.  In the latest Good Buy or Goodbye, Otto explains that Microsoft benefits from both a strong demand and a strong outlook for its Azure business. She also likes that it has a lot of potential growth from AI.  Otto is less of a fan of Meta. She argues that its higher expense guidance "suggests that the 'year of efficiency' is potentially over." So why is Mircosoft's spending on AI good, while Meta's spending is a concern? Otto says there are two reasons: Meta's expenses have ramped up more than expected and that there is a lack of visibility surrounding those expenses.

Some of the reports announced plans for major capital expenditures toward the development of AI projects. Niles Investment Management Founder Dan Niles joins Catalysts to explore how tech giants benefit from each other's earnings reports, as well as the market's reaction to tech earnings. "Meta came out first, and they guided below the Street for next quarter's revenues, but then they took up their cap-x as well as their expenses. Google came out after that, and remember, Meta went down 11%, and Google initiated a dividend, which was great, but if you look at the forward numbers, actually, the estimates across the Street actually edged down for revenues for their upcoming June quarter as well. So, I think to some extent, Google benefitted from Meta going first, and if you look at Microsoft, sort of a similar situation, where the stock was up, I think, 2% or so the next day, but again, they came after Meta, and Microsoft's forward revenue numbers edged down slightly as well," Niles explained.

Against this backdrop, Advisors Capital Management Partner and Portfolio Manager JoAnne Feeney joins Wealth! to discuss how investors should navigate the market. Feeney notes that earnings results from Big Tech names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META) have enabled the markets to sustain their upward momentum despite a Federal Reserve rate cut not yet materializing. Many of these companies are "on track to grow" on the back of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, she adds.  Feeney acknowledges that "there's a lot of mixed information coming out of the markets," emphasizing the importance of investing in individual stocks instead of taking a broad approach. Although the Fed hasn't cut rates, she describes it as a "good news story" because the economy remains strong, and earnings continue to grow. "What you have to do is not look at the market as a whole, but look at individual companies with strong demand drivers that are in the right place in the market for how the world is changing," Feeney tells Yahoo Finance.

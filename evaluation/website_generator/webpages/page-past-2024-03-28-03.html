The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is closing the quarter at a new record high, marking the best first quarter since 2019. While 2023 saw the Magnificent Seven tech stocks fuel market gains initially, the first quarter of 2024 is ending with only four of those names — Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) — carrying the momentum. Apple (AAPL) continues to struggle, declining for three straight months. As the gains broaden to other sectors of the market, Energy, Materials, Utilities, and Financials all benefited and were the best-performing sectors for the first quarter.

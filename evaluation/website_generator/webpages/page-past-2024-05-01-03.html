Photobucket CEO Ted Leonard joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the company's approach to this new venture. Drawing a parallel between AI training and how the human brain learns, Leonard compares the process to "a race to ingest content." He details the origins of Photobucket, explaining that the platform's core purpose was "public viewing, public sharing," uniquely positioning the company to step into the world of licensing data to AI companies. However, Leonard emphasizes that not all data on the Photobucket platform is open for AI training usage. The company prides itself on its commitment to privacy protection, and Leonard ensures they use a process to pick the content that can be utilized for AI training purposes.

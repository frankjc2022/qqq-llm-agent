Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton bring on the leading experts and market strategists to talk about where the market is headed and how US-China trade relations could impact growth. Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni joins the program to discuss movements in small and mid cap stocks, touching on which direction tech sector trends could move in based on the Federal Reserve's commitment to interest rate cuts. KraneShares Managing Director David Adelman, who also served as the US ambassador to Singapore, comments on the role stricter US export controls could have on pushing China to possibly "accelerate... development of its ecosystem." Wedbush Securities SVP of equity research Matt Bryson believes the US-China trade policies won't have much effect on chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA). Other top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform include Tesla (TSLA), Charles Schwab (SCHW), JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) after the pharma giant reported a second-quarter beat on earnings estimates.

Here's why</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-17 21:36:18+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>The cyberattack on CDK Global, the software provider for car dealerships across the US and Canada, led to system outages for auto dealers across North America. Meanwhile, prices for new cars remain well above pre-pandemic levels. CoPilot founder and CEO Pat Ryan joins Asking For A Trend to give insight into the CDK hack and why auto prices haven't decreased at a faster rate. "It really threw the industry back to the Stone Age in a lot of ways because with the systems locked down, they [car dealerships] couldn't do business the way they are," Ryan says on the hack. "These are typically their systems of record. And as their systems of record, they're kind of a hub for everything that they do." In turn, the cyber breach inhibited customers' ability to check car prices and for the dealers to update their websites and pricing. "You couldn't get information to send loans to the banks. I mean, it just gummed up everything and, now, it happened at a time that the market's been slowing, but dealers feel a lot of headwinds," Ryan says. Ryan points to "structural increases in car prices" leading consumer pressures: "We're still up over 30% from pre-COVID. So there's sticker shock for people who have bought a car since before COVID. And then when you add in that most cars are bought with financing, about 80% of cars. And so when your car is bought with financing, interest rates go up and prices go up. That has a compounding effect that has really made them unaffordable." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Asking for a Trend.

Wall Street Alliance Group Partner Aadil Zaman joins Wealth! host Alexandra Canal to discuss the pullback and how investors should be positioning their portfolios. June saw a 3% increase in housing starts, although single-family home construction remains at an eight-month low. John Burns Research & Consulting director of research Rick Palacios Jr. comes onto the program to provide insights into the current housing market construction dynamics. Palacios highlights a significant downturn in multi-family housing starts, noting a nearly 23% year-over-year decline. While the majority of investors are confident the economy will see the Fed's goal of a soft landing, some worry that hard landing risks are underpriced amid a slowing consumer labor market and government spending. BlackRock Head of iShares Investment Strategy Americas Kristy Akullian breaks down how investors can manage risk and protect themselves in the event that a soft landing is not achieved. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has announced plans to contribute $45 million monthly to a Trump Super PAC in support of the former president's reelection campaign. This move comes despite potential conflicts with Trump's policy direction, as Trump's current vice presidential pick, Senator JD Vance (R-Oh.) seeks to eliminate nearly $100 billion in electric vehicle subsidies through his proposed "Drive American Act."

The major market averages (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are under pressure Wednesday morning, with the Nasdaq Composite falling by over 300 points — or over 1.6% — as semiconductor stocks drag down the tech-heavy indexes. As a new report from Bloomberg outlines the Biden administration's plans for stricter trade regulations on chip exports to China, Principal Asset Management chief global strategist Seema Shah explains: "In a way, this is not unexpected. I think everyone has been anticipating that,as you see this continuation of US-China tensions, that, unfortunately, some of these chip makers, technology almost falls right into the spotlight." However, InsingerGilissen senior analyst Jos Versteeg believes ASML (ASML) will continue to perform well despite the news, saying, "When you look at China, China semiconductor manufacturing, they are using mainly low-end chips and the US wants them to keep on producing low-end chips because the world needs it." Meanwhile, the US political landscape is heating up. In a recent Bloomberg interview, former President Donald Trump said he would allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to complete his term if reelected, as long as Trump thinks Powell is "doing the right thing." However, Trump doesn't think the Fed should cut rates before the election in November because that could help President Biden's reelection prospects. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who recently backed Trump in the 2024 election, announced on X, formerly Twitter, that he plans to relocate the headquarters of both SpaceX and X to Austin, Texas. This move is in response to a new California law regarding transgender rights in schools, bringing increased rhetoric to some of the biggest issues dominating the November election. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) posted its second quarter earnings Wednesday morning, beating estimates on its top and bottom lines. However, the pharmaceutical giant slashed its full-year profit forecast. Shares of Roche (ROG.SW) are also moving higher on Wednesday as the company reported positive results from its obesity drug trial for a once-a-day oral pill currently labeled CT-996.

"We feel that these companies should be a core position in the portfolio. No doubt about that, right? And potentially, the earnings will be good as well. But it's all about expectations. So again, in the short term for the retail investor, very difficult to predict," Zaman says. He explains that the concentration of more than 20% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lies in three stocks, which investors want to hold on to. However, he advises that "no individual stocks should be more than 5% of the portfolio, and invest in other areas of the market to protect yourselves." Focusing on Tesla (TSLA), Zaman notes that despite the stock's volatility, "in the long term it's going to do well." In order to navigate this dynamic, he encourages investors to limit their exposure "and be exposed to it in a very diversified way."

As these companies realize potential in their data sets and money to be made from digital advertising, they continue to vie for any competitive edge they can find. TikTok is an incredibly powerful platform that sees huge volumes of user traffic which in turn can drive consumer growth for companies, both large brands and small businesses. With the US leveraging a potential ban against TikTok if its parent company ByteDance doesn't divest from it, how can these tech giants stir up even tighter competition if a ban ends up going through? MikMak CEO Rachel Tipograph joins Catalysts to discuss her company's findings from ad revenue data and the power TikTok holds in the business world. Tipograph explains: "TikTok is typically now around our second most trafficked social platform. It goes Meta, then TikTok, then an environment like YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP), and then X is irrelevant. I share this because I'm not seeing brands pull back from TikTok. I think right now they're actually trying to put their pedal on the gas while TikTok's around. TikTok is an amazing channel to drive consumer growth. We're seeing it in beauty, we're starting to see it in grocery." She then affirms: "If TikTok was to go away, Meta would win, YouTube would win, CTV would win. TikTok is really a play of brand awareness and video, and so those dollars would just get reallocated."

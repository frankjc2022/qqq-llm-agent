Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith guide investors through the leading industry stories and into the day's market open. Wall Street and tech investors are abuzz about Tesla (TSLA) and what CEO Elon Musk's pay package — valued at around $46 billion in the company's current stock price — is indicating about the future growth of the EV maker. Wedbush Securities Managing Director & Senior Equity Analyst Dan Ives details his latest forecast stipulating Tesla's market cap could be over $1 trillion in 2025. Clean Energy Transition CEO and Portfolio Manager Per Lekander later chimes in on why he believes Tesla is "the biggest stock market bubble in history" and that it could be "the next Enron." In stock news, Apple (AAPL) continues to hold the most valuable company title at the open after it's market cap surpassed Microsoft's (MSFT).

Goldman Sachs Senior Equity Research Analyst Eric Sheridan discusses the outlook for the digital consumer, emphasizing that the situation is nuanced rather than clear-cut. He acknowledges a slowdown in consumer spending but does not foresee a recession impacting the digital economy. Sheridan highlights that cloud computing companies are experiencing immediate returns on AI investments, while consumer adoption of AI technologies is slower, as many consumers maintain their internet habits from 18-24 months ago, around the time ChatGPT gained popularity. He notes that it typically takes time for consumers to adjust their computing behaviors, which explains the lag in consumer adoption compared to enterprise returns.

The tech giant posted adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 versus the Street's $5.65 estimate. Revenue of $26.04 billion was better than the Bloomberg consensus of $24.69 billion and up 262% from a year ago. Data center revenue rose 427% from a year ago to $22.6 billion, topping expectations of $21.13 billion. Nvidia also announced a 10-for-1 stock split that will occur after the market close on June 7. The company is also raising its dividend from $0.04 to $0.10, which the company says is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis. For the second quarter, Nvidia expects to report revenue of $28 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared to the $26.6 billion estimate.

Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist Lou Basenese joins Asking for a Trend to break down the earnings and analyze how long the company can keep up the momentum. Despite beating Wall Street's expectations, Basenese highlights that the magnitude of Nvidia's beat is the smallest it has ever been, at about 8%. He warns, "Expectations at some point are going to get too far ahead of what Nvidia can deliver, but it's not yet." "I think it's the leading candidate to be the next $3 trillion market cap company, but if I had a dollar to put to work today and I want to 10x it, it's not Nvidia. It's probably in the smaller cap side of the market," he adds, saying that of the "Magnificent Seven," Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is the most "reasonably valued." Basenese calls Nvidia's stock split a "brilliant move psychologically," as buying a stock at a lower price is more enticing. He adds that it does not change any of Nvidia's fundamental metrics or value calculations. For investors looking to get in on the AI sector, Basenese highlights Microsoft's (MSFT) ability to push AI products onto the market to create demand. He also points to Apple (AAPL) as "the sleeper AI play."  "Apple is kind of perceived as they missed the boat ... they're never first or second to market. They come in later, but then they go. They come in late, but they end up being the leader." He adds, "They have two billion active devices in use. If they just iterate and add a little AI somewhere, it has a magnified impact."

RBC Capital Markets Software Equity Analyst Rishi Jaluria and Macquarie Head of US AI & Software Research Frederick Havemeyer join Market Domination to discuss the company's latest AI play. "I think the introduction of these AI PCs is actually going to be a really big game changer to getting generative AI in the hands of every knowledge worker out there," Jaluria explains. He adds that users will be able to use these small and medium language models locally, generating more AI use for general purposes. When it comes to large language models, Havemeyer says, "It's very clear to us that the technology of a generative AI model of large language models is something that will find fit with consumers over time. ChatGPT did, and I think that with the right interface and the right platform, we'll find it over time." AI is seeping into all sectors as companies seek to innovate and find efficiencies. "80% of CIOs are telling us that they are either currently in production or expect to be in production with AI over the next 12 months, so the appetite is real, the use cases are real," Jaluria explains, adding that there is still a lot of room for the technology to grow.

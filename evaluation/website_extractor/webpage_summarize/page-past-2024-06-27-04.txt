The text provides a summary of recent news regarding major tech companies, particularly focusing on Tesla and Meta. 

Tesla is currently in the spotlight due to a court case concerning CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which shareholders voted to reinstate despite a previous ruling that voided it. The company argues that the shareholder vote should resolve the legal debate over Musk's compensation. Additionally, Tesla's quality rankings have declined, with a recent survey showing it falling behind competitors like GM and Ford. Design changes in Tesla vehicles, such as the removal of turn-signal stalks, have frustrated owners and contributed to this decline in quality.

In the electric vehicle (EV) sector, Volkswagen has announced a $5 billion investment in Rivian to develop vehicle software, indicating a collaborative approach among automakers to compete with Tesla. Analysts are closely monitoring Tesla's stock performance, noting that if it can surpass $207 per share, it may reach $225, but disappointing delivery numbers could lead to a drop to $170.

On the other hand, Meta is facing legal challenges, including a lawsuit alleging discrimination against U.S. citizens in favor of foreign workers. Despite regulatory hurdles, Meta is rolling out AI tools in the EU and collaborating with the NCAA on a new program. The company is also introducing advanced AI technology, such as the Meta Llama 3, which is touted as a significant advancement in open AI models.

Overall, the tech landscape is marked by legal battles, competitive collaborations, and ongoing developments in AI and EV technologies.

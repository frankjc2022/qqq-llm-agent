The problems affect Samsung's HBM3 chips, which are the fourth-generation HBM standard currently most used in graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence, as well as fifth-generation HBM3E chips that the South Korean tech giant and its rivals are bringing to market this year, they said.

Chip powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) beat its fiscal first-quarter earnings, reported on Wednesday, and CEO Jensen Huang believes artificial intelligence will continue to be a "giant market opportunity" for the company. Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin and Harvest Portfolio Management Co-CIO and Wall Street Beats Partner Paul Meeks sit down with Yahoo Finance's Market Domination to share their perspectives on Nvidia's positive quarter and where the company can go in artificial intelligence inferencing, or the process of training an AI model by running new data through it. "This is where the works really gotta come in to really understand where these workloads are going to go. Looking at where a lot of big businesses and enterprises are going to want to run their workloads, either in the cloud or on PRAM, and I do believe there's something to this," Bajarin lays out. "AI factories, sovereign AI, that's going to happen. But does that mean that's totally Nvidia systems? I think that's that's still an open question. It's really going to come down to cost." Bajarin and Meeks also weigh in on where other hyperscaler cloud service providers and PC companies fit into the greater AI race.

Christopher Miller, assistant professor of international History at Tufts University, joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the landscape of chip manufacturing. Miller notes that the leading chipmakers in the US heavily depend on the semiconductor giants in Taiwan, stating, "it does present a risk that I think investors have to take seriously." With the surge in chip manufacturing investments occurring in the US, Miller believes that "it won't be complete self-sufficiency, but it does mean a lot more resilience, especially in case of a political crisis in East Asia." When it comes to China, Miller suggests that "China is probably going to be close to self-sufficient" in creating chips near the end of the decade. However, he points out that China faces challenges in manufacturing high-end chips, as "right now it's all in Taiwan."

The semiconductor giant also raised its guidance for the next quarter, sparking a widespread rally in global chip markets. Morningstar Equity Analyst of Technology William Kerwin joins Morning Brief to discuss his outlook on Micron following the beat-and-raise. Kerwin acknowledges that the results "were nothing short of impressive," but notes that this doesn't alter his long-term view on the company. He emphasizes that Micron is currently riding "a cyclical upswing" in memory demand, which he expects to continue through 2025. However, he cautions that this dynamic will eventually decelerate, suggesting that the current rally "is a correction from too much pessimism" from investors, even as the fundamentals remain robust. "As much as we liked the print, [and] we like the next four quarters for Micron, we still see long-term cyclicality in the future," Kerwin states. He believes this cyclical nature will ultimately weigh on the share price, leading him to maintain a target of $110, despite the stock hitting that milestone on the heels of this earnings report.

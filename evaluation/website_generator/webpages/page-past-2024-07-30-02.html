In its report after the bell, Microsoft said revenue from its Intelligent Cloud unit - home to the Azure cloud-computing platform - jumped 19% to $28.5 billion in the quarter ended June 30, but missed analysts' estimates of $28.7 billion, LSEG data showed.  Its capital expenditure, including finance leases, jumped 78% in the quarter to $19 billion, with Microsoft saying it needs to expand its global network of data centers and overcome capacity constraints to meet AI demand.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Microsoft's Azure Cloud growth: Analyst on why it disappointed</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-30 22:02:22+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) are falling more than 5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company reported its fiscal fourth quarter results, revealing its intelligent cloud segment missed expectations. RBC Capital Markets Software equity analyst Rishi Jaluria joins Asking For A Trend to give insight into Microsoft's results. Jaluria says his biggest takeaway from the report was that there has been "a little bit of a reversal of the trends that we saw last quarter." He says the issue is that Azure "ex-AI" decelerated in this quarter whereas it had accelerated the prior quarter. He says he will be looking for more information about the company's capital expenditures outlook on the call. In terms of what to expect with the AI sector Jaluria states: "I think what we're learning is it's very early in AI. Capex is going to be through the roof because this AI is really capital intensive. It's totally resource intensive. And there is a little bit of an air pocket behind enterprises having discussions in AI and actually using AI widely within the organization. And at the same time, I do think we are seeing some competitive dynamics where Azure may be potentially gaining share versus the other hyperscale cloud providers."

The text discusses recent developments and stock performance of major tech companies, particularly Tesla (TSLA) and Meta Platforms (META). 

Tesla's stock has faced challenges following its third-quarter delivery numbers, which fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts express skepticism about Tesla's ability to grow annual sales, even with price cuts, and highlight the upcoming robotaxi event as a critical moment for the company. Despite the delivery numbers being better than anticipated, the stock dropped due to high prior expectations. Analysts suggest that investors should focus more on gross profit rather than just delivery figures, as Tesla's valuation may hinge on future developments like the robotaxi and energy storage solutions.

In contrast, Meta Platforms is experiencing a surge, reaching a 52-week high, driven by strong advancements in artificial intelligence. The company is heavily investing in AI infrastructure, which is seen as crucial for its future growth. Analysts are optimistic about Meta's potential, suggesting it could be a top pick for momentum investors. The company has also been proactive in addressing regulatory challenges, particularly in the EU, and is rolling out new AI tools and products, including augmented reality glasses.

Overall, the tech sector is viewed as poised for long-term growth, with both Tesla and Meta navigating their respective challenges and opportunities in the evolving market landscape.

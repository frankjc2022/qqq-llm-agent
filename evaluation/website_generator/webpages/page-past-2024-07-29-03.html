Meta is up first, with many investors concerned about how much advertisers are spending on its platforms. RBC Capital Markets internet analyst Brad Erickson joins Market Domination to give insight into Meta's upcoming earnings and what investors should know about its performance in the advertising space, while also briefly touching on Amazon. "We think Meta is actually going to guide just fine. We know there's a lot of concern. We know there's a lot of smoke out there in the macro, but we do think fundamental results are going to be there. Now, the kicker on Meta is how is Mark Zuckerberg going to sound on capex, the metaverse, AI, and return on investment timeline very, very hard to predict. But fundamentally, I think we're feeling actually quite good on Meta heading into the print." Watch the video above to hear which stock Erickson prefers: Amazon or Meta?

Investors are keenly watching to see how AI spending will impact company revenues. Neuberger Berman senior research Analyst Daniel Flax joins Market Domination to discuss his outlook. Flax believes that upcoming tech earnings will highlight "the buildout of the cloud infrastructure" and AI. With Amazon and Microsoft earnings on the horizon, he notes, "I expect they'll see strong growth" within Azure and Amazon Web Services. He points out that the cloud businesses among tech giants are generating substantial revenues, arguing that "this need to invest, I think, is the right strategy," despite acknowledging that revenue generation from AI specifically will take time. "I do think the investments or the capital expenditures are a necessary part of it. I expect you'll see incremental revenues from these newer areas over the next 12-24 months. The key though... these are very healthy businesses for these companies," Flax told Yahoo Finance.

What is helping this rotation and is it just a short term movement? Liz Young Thomas SoFi head of investment strategy joins Market Domination to give insight into Big Tech earnings and what investors need to know during this current economic cycle. In terms of how investors are moving during this notion of a rotation, Young Thomas states: "I think what's going on actually right now with the rotation is that some of those big cap tech names have given some back, because when people look at their portfolios, that is the easiest stuff to sell. You've got a big gain in it. It's a very liquid name, professional investors see those as easy to sell as well. So it's an easy place to take some profits and rotate. And I think the beneficiary of that rotation right now... has been small caps." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

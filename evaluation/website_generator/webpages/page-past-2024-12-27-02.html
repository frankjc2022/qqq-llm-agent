He suggests that, although stocks like Apple are trending upward, the "Magnificent Seven" — which comprises Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) — may become the "lag seven" in 2025 as "the relative performance has not been nearly as strong." Johnson shares his strategy for navigating the shifting tech landscape in the coming year. "I would rather see investors — and I suspect this will happen as you get into early 2025 — taking some, not all, but some of their profits out of those larger cap stocks, reducing those positions, and then again, recognizing some of those gains that they may not have wanted to recognize in 2024 and [shifting] down cap, looking at stocks like Twilio (TWLO)." He also highlights Robinhood (HOOD) as an opportunity for investors, given the "more friendly crypto policy from the new administration." Johnson advises viewers not to forget optical companies, like Coherent (COHR), which "could be a better place to put some money to work."

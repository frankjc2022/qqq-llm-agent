Tesla has faced considerable challenges, with its stock plummeting below $150, erasing gains from the past year. The company is grappling with declining sales and has implemented steep discounts to attract buyers. Analysts express concerns over Tesla's strategic pivot towards developing a robotaxi, which they deem "extremely risky" for investors. Deutsche Bank has downgraded Tesla's stock rating, citing potential long-term challenges if the company shifts focus away from its core electric vehicle production. Additionally, Tesla is seeking shareholder approval for Elon Musk's controversial $56 billion compensation package, which was previously voided by a judge due to concerns over fairness to investors.

In contrast, Meta is making strides in artificial intelligence, recently launching its Llama 3 AI model, which aims to enhance user experience across various platforms. Despite facing regulatory hurdles in the EU, Meta continues to roll out AI tools, showcasing its commitment to innovation in the tech space. The companyâ€™s advancements in AI are seen as a competitive edge, particularly as it seeks to improve user engagement amidst criticism regarding its AI agents.

Overall, the tech sector is experiencing volatility, with Tesla's struggles contrasting with Meta's progress in AI technology. Investors are closely monitoring these developments as they could significantly impact market dynamics and company valuations in the near future.

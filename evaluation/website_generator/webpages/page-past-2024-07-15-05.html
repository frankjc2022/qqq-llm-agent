The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI)close at a record high in Monday's session, closing 0.53% higher. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ended the day in the green, slightly below their record closes. The S&P 500 hit an all-time high intraday. Former President Donald Trump has announced Senator JD Vance (R-Oh.) as his vice presidential pick just days after surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Unlimited co-founder, CEO, and CIO Bob Elliott notes that following the assassination attempt, the odds of Trump winning the election have increased. He explains, "What we're seeing is actually gold (GC=F) as one of the best-performing assets in the market, reflective of the fact that we're likely to get large deficits ahead as the Republicans have a higher probability of controlling all three chambers of the US government. We're seeing bonds sell off as a function of growth likely being stronger and having those larger deficits and higher inflation." Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is in talks to acquire cyber security startup Wiz for $23 billion, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill is excited by the deal, stating: "I think this makes a lot more sense given that they [Wiz] can address both small, mid, and large enterprises with this technology. That the government — there's zero chance, in my opinion, they could push back on this because it's enabling the security and safety of data, and no one has dominant market share, so it makes a lot of sense for us... I'd be a lot more excited as a shareholder if this was happening." Finally, Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down what to watch on Tuesday, July 15, from major bank earnings to the kickoff Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Day.

That the government--there's zero chance, in my opinion, they could push back on this because it's enabling the security and safety of data, and no one has dominant market share, so it makes a lot of sense for us. So, again, we've heard a lot of chatter, and M&A by Google. None of it's happened, clearly, the HubSpot deal, at least in the interim, fell apart. But this deal, in my opinion, makes a lot more sense. I'd be a lot more excited as a shareholder if this was happening.

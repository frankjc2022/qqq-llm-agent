With its bright yellow paint job, the Seagull looks a little like a Minion from the back, even if it looks a tad grumpy from the front.  A 100% import penalty will be placed on EVs like the hot-selling BYD Seagull, or the GAC AION S, while select batteries and battery components will be hit with a 25% levy.  The penalties effectively block Chinese companies from bringing their cars to America and prompt U.S. auto makers to invest in domestic EV component manufacturers.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Under-investing in Mag 7 could mean 'big trouble': Strategist</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-05-24 20:05:26+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>With Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings failing to drive markets the way investors had hoped, Commerce Street Capital CEO Dory Wiley joins Market Domination to share his market outlook and discuss how investors should position themselves within the Big Tech sector. Wiley highlights the importance of Nvidia's earnings: "Nvidia drives Mag 7, Mag 7 drives the market." He acknowledges that Nvidia "blew it out of the water" with its results. However, he notes that Big Tech has been "a weak spot in the market" despite Nvidia's value proposition. Despite the recent pressure on Big Tech and the "Magnificent 7," Wiley remains optimistic about these stocks' long-term prospects: "[They] have fundamental reasons to keep growing and to keep driving the markets ...

Tesla shareholders are set to vote on this on June 13 after the Delaware Chancery Court struck it down. But Musk isn't the only chief executive seeking enormous executive pay packages.

Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith walk investors through the top stories moving stocks in Friday's trading day, kicking off the session with Truist Co-Chief Investment Officer and Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner who compares the market sway of Nvidia's latest earnings to that of inflation data or the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ether ETF offerings on Thursday, leading Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Research Analyst James Seyffart to believe ethereum-exposed (ETH-USD) products will have similar success to the spot bitcoin ETFs (BTC-USD) rolled out at the start of 2024, just not on the same scale. Other top trending stories include the latest in the Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust suit against concert promoter and ticket seller Live Nation (LYV) and Charter Communications' (CHTR) content distribution deal with Paramount Global (PARA).

Pernas Research Co-Founder Deiya Pernas and Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney join Market Domination to discuss the state of index investing. Pernas believes investors' biggest worry should be "complacency" in the indexes. "The market's trading at 21 times forward. and it's somewhat typical of late-cycle that you see large cap quality do quite well and that's what we've seen this year," Pernas elaborates, pointing out small cap equities' value growth is flat and may not be participating in market rallies. "If you look at it holistically, there's some areas of the market where cracks are evident, but again, at the index level, I think there's a lot of complacency." "Tere's a lot of examples this earnings season, especially in technology, so we don't need to be near airlines and autos or retailers or some of these other ones that are mentioned. We don't need to be in those industries," Mahoney explains, later going on to discuss big names in tech. "We're in the fast lane, we're growth managers. We accept the bumpy ride in the left lane, but that's where all the CapEx spending, that's where the excitement is. The multiples can expand when we have this type of opportunity..."

Google's Axion is a custom Arm-based server chip and Intel's Gaudi 3 is an AI chip designed to take on Nvidia's (NVDA) most popular AI processors. Moor Insights & Strategies founder and CEO Patrick Moorhead joins Market Domination to give insight into the booming chip sector and how these announcements will impact the market. Speaking on Google's announcement and position in AI sector, Moorhead states, "Google has a lot to prove. I don't think anybody is questioning the company's technical competency. In fact, they wrote the groundbreaking research paper on generative AI and I think what people are questioning is, can they extend what they do in consumer search to the generative AI world? And then I think even more difficult, extending it to the commercial market, which is what the conference I'm at right now it is all about and they've had some stumbles. Every major announcement that they've made has come with some baggage." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

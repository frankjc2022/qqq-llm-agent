And it all started with a post on X (formerly Twitter) made Sunday night by user "Roaring Kitty," the handle of retail trader Keith Gill that sparked the original meme trade frenzy around GameStop (GME) in early 2021. tastylive Founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff sits down with Yahoo Finance's Market Domination to share his thoughts on the "welcomed" and renewed excitement around meme stocks. Infrastructure Capital Advisors CEO Jay Hatfield joins Julie Hyman for the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye, shedding light on which major player in the financial space he is all in on. Also, watch for the latest coverage around Walgreens' (WBA) plans to sell off its UK chain Boots, the latest iteration of OpenAI's ChatGPT artificial intelligence model, and Kraft Heinz's (KHC) intent to sell the Oscar Mayer brand.

A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey, released on Monday, found that Americans see inflation at 3.3% a year from now from March’s 3% while they expect inflation three years from now at 2.8%.  This followed a University of Michigan report on Friday that showed U.S. consumer sentiment sagged to a six-month low in May as households worried about the cost of living.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>OpenAI's GPT-4o: Google, Apple at 'risk' if they don't catch up</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-05-13 20:27:17+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>OpenAI announced a new flagship chatbot called GPT-4o, which can operate in 50 different languages with improved speed and quality, according to Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. This announcement comes ahead of a potential deal between OpenAI and Apple (AAPL) to put ChatGPT in iPhones, Bloomberg reports. Moor Insights & Strategy Founder and CEO Patrick Moorhead joins Market Domination to give insight into the announcement from OpenAI and its potential deal with Apple. Moorhead outlines why this announcement was important for OpenAI despite lagging evidence about the impact of AI adoption: "Technology is always slower to be adopted than we all think it's going to. In Silicon Valley, it comes overnight. But the reality is to hit typical consumers and even businesses come years after use. But you have to show off the latest and greatest to get people excited. It's kind of like the beginning of an investment bubble, right? Let's get everybody excited. Let's show the capability we're going to hit the trough of disillusionment at some point, but it's to get people tied in."

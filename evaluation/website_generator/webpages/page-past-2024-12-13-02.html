One asset manager weighs in</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-12-13 21:26:04+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney joined Market Domination to discuss the potential for a stock split at Netflix (NFLX). Mahoney noted that Netflix is no stranger to stock splits, having previously executed them in February 2004 and July 2015. With Netflix trading above $900, he explained, "There's a good precedent that once a stock gets over $600... to do a split." He pointed to Nvidia (NVDA) as a recent example, which completed a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year and was subsequently added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). The CEO further highlighted that a stock split would attract more investors to Netflix shares. The current price may be "out of reach for the average investor," but a split would open the stock to a broader demographic. Mahoney forecasts that Netflix could potentially opt for a 10-for-1 stock split to increase accessibility.

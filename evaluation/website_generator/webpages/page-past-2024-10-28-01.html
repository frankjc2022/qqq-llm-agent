The iPhone maker launched its Apple Intelligence features on Monday through its iOS 18.1 software update Investors are looking to see if the newly revealed Apple Intelligence will have a noticeable impact for the tech company. TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Asking for a Trend to discuss. "As of today, it's Apple semi-Intelligence because we're not quite totally there yet," he explains. Despite rolling out features like Genmoji and text-writing capabilities, the company faces the same challenge as its competitors: "convincing consumers that this AI stuff matters." "Apple's going to really have to convince consumers that there is value in this capability, and it's going to take a long time," O'Donnell states. He doesn't anticipate seeing a significant AI impact in the company's upcoming earnings report. However, he believes that over the long term, these AI features will enhance the usability of Apple devices, and it will "kind of sneak up on us." Watch the video above to hear what O'Donnell says about Big Tech's capital expenditures on artificial intelligence.

Oppenheimer’s senior analyst of emerging technologies and services, Martin Yang, joins Josh Lipton and Josh Schafer on Market Domination to discuss what the artificial intelligence (AI) focused update means for the iPhone maker just ahead of its quarterly earnings report. Yang explains that while “the 18.1 iOS and iPad updates were released today,” Apple Intelligence features are “not immediately accessible. You have to join the waitlist and then get notified to use the features.” “The rollout is gradual,” he says, adding, “It takes time to get global consumers or global iPhone and iPad users to access the feature. We don't know how the broad-based consumers will respond to those just yet.” Ahead of Apple’s earnings report on Thursday, the analyst outlines what he’s watching for when the iPhone maker releases results. “Things we'll be watching for is the iPhone. ‘Is the iPhone revenue trend still stable? And are they getting better comps in Greater China sales?’ Those are the key topics I'll be watching.” He adds that he will also be monitoring for the breakdown of standard iPhone sales compared to Pro and Pro Max models, as well as Services revenue.

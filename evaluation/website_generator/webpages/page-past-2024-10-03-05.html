Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI managing director, joins Josh Schafer and Madison Mills on Market Domination to take a look at the energy sector. Chopra says “the single largest catalyst” for independent power producers (IPPs) like Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vista Energy (VIST) is “the need for clean energy, 24/7 energy by these data centers.” The analyst says reopening dormant nuclear plants is “going to be the next big thing” in energy. He notes,” We have to be careful to balance this demand trend that we bring supply on time while also not disrupting the balance of residential customer builds. So I think that's a key challenge. But this is a good position for utilities to be in.” For investors looking to get in on the AI-driven energy boom, Chopra says he doesn’t think the utilities sector is currently overbought. “Some of these IPPs may seem expensive on earnings, but there's a tremendous amount of EPS upside… I think there's more to go.” He expects utilities to outperform the market led by the IPPs by the end of the quarter. Chopra adds that the opportunity in energy stocks is more long-term. “The reality is you build something new today, whether it's a gas plant, whether it's wind, solar storage, small modular reactors, all of these technologies are five to seven years build time… So these things are going to take some time. But they're all additive to earnings and should boost the long-term growth profile of the utility sector.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened lower on Thursday amid the latest labor market data and increasing Middle East tensions. Initial jobless claims for the week ending September 28 rose to 225,000, slightly above the estimated 221,000. Oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) are continuing to spike as tensions boil between Israel and Iran. US stock markets are experiencing a period of heightened volatility, driven by a variety of factors including Hurricane Helene, the upcoming US presidential election, and escalating Middle East tensions. The Wealth Consulting Group's chief market strategist Talley Léger acknowledges that markets have been hit by numerous events that could potentially unsettle investors, questioning, "when are they perfectly certain?" However, he notes that such turbulence is a common occurrence in financial markets, adding that "through it all, the stock market has continued its inexorable march forward." Due to this dynamic, Léger advises investors to view market dips as potential buying opportunities. The rotation out of Big Tech has become evident, with the standout "Magnificent Seven" (AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, GOOGL, AMZN, META, MSFT, NVDA) names no longer being the market frontrunners they once were. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza notes that the Magnificent Seven's market leadership "hit an abrupt stop" in mid-July, fueled by the unwinding of the yen carry trade. While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes "it's too early to give up" on the Magnificent Seven. Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt’s senior research analyst, outlines his bullish stance on Meta. “The growth supports the multiple… The bigger backdrop, we think, is that people are getting more comfortable with Meta’s strategic positioning. Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.” Crockett explains. The Hang Seng (^HSI) ended the day lower after 13 straight days of gains following a wave of stimulus measures aimed at bolstering the country's struggling economy. While JPMorgan has warned investors about the risks of chasing the rally given its high valuations, KraneShares CIO Brendan Ahern argues it's still in the "very, very early innings." With more information about fiscal policy expected from Chinese officials, the rally could continue. He adds, "Instead of looking through the rearview mirror, let's look through the windshield."

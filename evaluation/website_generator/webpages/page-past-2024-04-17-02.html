Companies like Nvidia, whose software offerings are as important to its overall business as its chips, do not want to wait that long to start writing code for the chips.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Markets: Nasdaq closes 180 lower, losses seen across tech</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-04-17 20:14:30+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) reversed course throughout Wednesday and ended up closing the session lower.

With more and more companies getting involved in AI, it can be hard for any investor to wade through the names and find a great entry point for their portfolio. Morgan Stanley Equity Analyst Stephen Byrd joins Yahoo Finance to break down some of the best AI picks that have gone under the radar for many on Wall Street and what investors need to keep in mind with the AI sector. Byrd points out one of the biggest drives behind his picks and why they have much room to grow: "We see about a 50% drop in... essentially the cost of compute, cost of computation, in these data centers. That's really all Nvidia (NVDA). It's these new chips that are just much more efficient. And that's flowing through the entire ecosystem. As those costs drop, we think demand for a variety of gen. AI applications will rise, and that's essentially the thesis of our view of gen. AI adoption across many industries."

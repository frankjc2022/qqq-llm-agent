As the post-election rally searches for direction, what are some of the core themes becoming apparent in retail investor behavior? Investopedia Editor-In-Chief Caleb Silver sits down with Josh Lipton to expand upon the retail investor reaction to recent market moves and proposed policies by President-elect Donald Trump, finding ETFs and crypto to very much be on retail investors' radars. "We asked them that question very specifically, what of the policies that the Trump administration has promised, Do you think will be the most beneficial or the most hurtful to your portfolio? Obviously, the ones that would be the most hurtful are the ones you think of tariffs," Silver says. "But when you ask them on the flip side, what about taxes? A lower corporate tax rate, lower income tax breaks, more income tax breaks, obviously that's a positive... but I think investors are caught between this 'we kinda see what this future might look like, but it's still unclear about how that impacts our money' [messaging]."

Musk alleges OpenAI and early leaders conspired to defraud him by putting commercial interests before the public good. Cornell Tech Policy Institute Director Sarah Kreps joins Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to provide an overview of the lawsuit and how Musk's new role in Trump's White House affects the case. "The lawsuit is interesting in itself, and I think is emblematic of a lot of the complications and complexities of these issues," Kreps says, adding, "In this case with Microsoft and Elon Musk's concern about antitrust, I found [it] very interesting that he was adding Microsoft to this lawsuit in the sense that Microsoft is good at a lot of things. but one of the things that's probably best at is defending against antitrust [allegations]. It has a lot of experience from the 1990s and early 2000s. But it certainly seems peculiar now, or not surprising given that OpenAI is worth about $157 billion, that Musk wants to get in on that action. But his role in the White House and his influence, I think, will complicate things considerably."

The strategist says not only does the Magnificent Seven group, made up of Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL), has more room to run in 2025, the stocks could actually function as a defensive play amid market uncertainty. "We're thinking the Mag Seven actually unfold as a quasi staple," Chronert says, explaining, "Usually you go to [consumer] staples when you have uncertain economic conditions because of the persistence of earnings growth." "The Mag Seven, we think, that forward-looking earnings growth for certainly for [2025] and probably into [2026] is fairly visible. So all told, when you get concerned about other things at work in the market and the economy, the Mag Seven actually have this potential to be a quote, defensive if you will." The strategist highlights the phrase "growth is defensive," saying, "That's what's going on here." He notes, "These companies probably can't just live on meeting expectations. They need to continue to meet beat and then probably raise forward expectations as well" to maintain their "defensive" status.

NYSE Senior Market Strategist Michael Reinking joins Morning Brief to discuss his outlook on breadth within the stock market. Reinking notes that the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) expanded in breadth post-election, with mega-cap tech stocks beginning to recover. "We're at kind of an area where you'd like to see that breadth expansion start to... pick back up," he says, highlighting concerns about higher inflation and the potential for fewer rate cuts in 2025. He identifies financials and industrials as sectors positioned to benefit from increased market breadth expansion. Regarding a catalyst for market breadth, Reinking characterizes it as "a prove it story," noting the earnings gap between the Magnificent 7 and the other equal-weighted stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is likely to narrow. "It's going to be a situation where you need to see companies, A) being able to meet their earnings expectations, but you want to see the earnings revisions start to move more positively for that equal weight... contingent," he explains.

The cyberattack on CDK Global, the software provider for car dealerships across the US and Canada, led to system outages for auto dealers across North America. Meanwhile, prices for new cars remain well above pre-pandemic levels. CoPilot founder and CEO Pat Ryan explains that the hack "really threw the industry back to the Stone Age in a lot of ways because with the systems locked down, they [car dealerships] couldn't do business the way they are." He also points to "structural increases in car prices" leading to consumer pressures: "We're still up over 30% from pre-COVID. So there's sticker shock for people who have bought a car since before COVID. And then when you add in that most cars are bought with financing, about 80% of cars. And so when your car is bought with financing, interest rates go up and prices go up. That has a compounding effect that has really made them unaffordable." The tech sector was dealt a major blow in Wednesday's trading session as chip giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), and ASML Holding (ASML) sank in the day's session. Meanwhile, signs of a so-called "Trump Trade" are ringing throughout Wall Street, specifically with interest in M&A activity which could see a pullback if the former president were to take the White House once again. Yahoo Finance markets reporter Josh Schafer joins the show to break down the latest market trends for July 17. The Russell 2000 (^RUT), an index tracking small caps, broke its 5-day winning streak at market close on Wednesday. Market Domination Anchor Julie Hyman breaks down the latest data pointing to potential signs of a rotation out of Big Tech. Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) TNT may be losing out on the media rights to the NBA as Comcast (CMCSA) has reportedly reached a deal with the basketball giant. In addition, Disney's (DIS) ESPN and Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video platform will be paying the NBA more for their game rights. Although Warner Bros. has the option to match the incoming offers, LightShed Partners media and technology analyst Rich Greenfield doubts it will: "I don't believe that Warner Bros. really wants to spend 1.8 plus billion dollars on a rights package for a much smaller package with less playoff games."

Discovery (WBD) and its TNT network out in the cold.  Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) and Disney's (DIS) ESPN are set to win the rights, though WBD still has time to match one of the current offers. LightShed Partners media and technology analyst Rich Greenfield told Yahoo Finance that he doesn't "believe that Warner Bros. really wants to spend $1.8 plus billion on a rights package for a much smaller package with less playoff games than they have now." Meanwhile, the media rights for the WNBA will reportedly see the league earning $2.2 billion over the next 11 years.

"We feel that these companies should be a core position in the portfolio. No doubt about that, right? And potentially, the earnings will be good as well. But it's all about expectations. So again, in the short term for the retail investor, very difficult to predict," Zaman says. He explains that the concentration of more than 20% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lies in three stocks, which investors want to hold on to. However, he advises that "no individual stocks should be more than 5% of the portfolio, and invest in other areas of the market to protect yourselves." Focusing on Tesla (TSLA), Zaman notes that despite the stock's volatility, "in the long term it's going to do well." In order to navigate this dynamic, he encourages investors to limit their exposure "and be exposed to it in a very diversified way."

Former President Donald Trump also made comments to Bloomberg about potentially making Taiwan pay for US defense.  Wedbush Securities SVP of equity research Matt Bryson joins Market Domination to give insights into the chip stock slide. "When you look at what the US is doing in terms of restricting capital equipment sales into China, if they are successful, certainly that would weigh on ASML (ASML), that would weigh on some of the other capital equipment names, Tokyo Electron (TOELY), and that's something to think about," Bryson says. "If China takes a harder stance and starts banning imports, that's something to think about. But, in terms of, again, things shifting immensely for someone like Nvidia (NVDA), where China is a relatively small portion of their revenue because there's already such significant restrictions in place. Thinking about moving away from Taiwan Semi (TSM) anytime in the next 2 to 3 years, I just don't think there's any real implications...There's just there's no alternative to Taiwan Semi."

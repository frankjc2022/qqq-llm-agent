    <h1>Trump slaps tariffs on biggest trade partners, Beyoncé leads heading into Grammy night: Weekend Rundown</h1>
    <p>Trump says tariffs may cause 'some pain' as Canada and Mexico retaliate</p>
    <p>President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on goods coming into the United States from Canada, Mexico and China, raising the risk of a trade war with America's closest trading partners.

Trump said he was imposing the tariffs because, he claimed, the countries were allowing fentanyl to come into the United States. "In Donald Trump's golden age," a senior administration official said, "we will only have legal immigration and we will have zero Americans dying from Chinese slash Mexican slash Canadian fentanyl."

Prices on many goods are likely to rise, with Trump acknowledging there might be "some pain" for consumers on Truth Social. The United States will begin collecting most of the tariffs Tuesday, with some exceptions.

Canada and Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau implementing a 25% tariff against $155 billion in U.S. goods. Trudeau warned Trump that "the better path is to partner with Canada, not to punish us."

He said the Canadian response would be "far-reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon, fruits and fruit juices, including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes."</p>
    <p>All three on board helicopter in D.C. crash are identified</p>
    <p>The identities of all three soldiers on the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a passenger jet Wednesday near Washington, D.C., have been released.

The Army named Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Lloyd Eaves, Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach and Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara. It said it had not finished recovering remains and making positive identifications.

As the investigation continues, families of the victims on the American Eagle flight gathered at the crash site Sunday for a memorial.

A separate National Transportation Safety Board investigation is underway into the air ambulance crash in Philadelphia, where six people in the plane and a person in a car were killed. Mayor Cherelle Parker said Sunday that 22 people were injured, three of them critically.</p>
    <p>Israeli American included in latest round of hostage releases</p>
    <p>The fourth hostage-prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas took place early Saturday, with Hamas releasing three hostages and Israel releasing 183 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.

One of the freed hostages was Keith Siegel, an Israeli American who was taken from kibbutz Kfar Aza during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Siegel was reunited with family members at an Israeli hospital.

Also reunited with his family was Ofer Kalderon, who was taken hostage with his children Sahar, 16, and Erez, 12, who were freed in November 2023.

Yarden Bibas, the third hostage released by Hamas, had been taken hostage along with his wife and two young children. Hamas has said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike, but the Bibas family has held on to hope that they are still alive.

    <p>Meet the Press
</p>
    <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem did not rule out housing women and children set for deportation at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in the wake of a Trump administration announcement that called for plans to house thousands of migrants at a U.S. military camp there.

"Due process will be followed, and having facilities at Guantánamo Bay will be an asset to us," Noem said Sunday in an interview on NBC News' "Meet the Press."

Noem reiterated the administration's goal of housing the "worst of the worst" migrants at Guantánamo Bay, referring to those who have committed crimes while living in the United States illegally.

</p>
    <p>Asked once whether women and children would be held at Guantánamo Bay, Noem said: "If you look at what we are doing today, it's targeting the worst of the worst. We've been very clear on that. The priority of this president is to go after criminal aliens that are making our streets more dangerous."

She added: "After that, we have final removal orders on many individuals in this country, they are the next priority, and we'll continue to work through people that are breaking the law, that are [a] danger to these communities, and use the detention centers that we have set up in order to facilitate this in an orderly way."

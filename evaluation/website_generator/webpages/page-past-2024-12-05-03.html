BMO Capital Markets senior analyst Simeon Siegel posed to Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on Opening Bid. "If it doubles, will you?" to which Sozzi answered an unequivocal 'no.' Well, that is the reality that retail products might face should Trump's 25% tariffs go into effect, Siegel explained. "I think the question is if prices are raised because of tariffs—or if prices are raised because the company thinks they can just charge more. It's not how life works. The consumer dictates." The consumer will bear the burden of the price or decide if they're not willing to. For full episodes of Opening Bid, watch on our website or listen on your favorite podcast platform.

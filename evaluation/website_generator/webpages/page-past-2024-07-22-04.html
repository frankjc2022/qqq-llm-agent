Jefferies global head of sustainability and transition strategy Aniket Shah joins Market Domination to discuss the move and whether a Trump presidency would actually benefit the EV maker. At a recent rally, Trump talked about getting rid of EV mandates, which Shah says would be "quite bullish for the EV market." He believes that EVs have been "caught up in the culture wars of this country," and that Elon Musk's endorsement sends a message: "Elon Musk saying that, you know what? We actually don't need these tax credits anymore from the US government and President Trump saying that if people want to buy them, they should buy them. And that's that. I actually don't think that's a bad outcome for the decarbonization of the transportation industry." He notes that if Trump takes the White House, "there will be headline risk, but the reality is, is that there's a technological revolution that is happening right now in the transportation industry." He argues that Tesla kicked off the revolution, and now that there are more companies introducing more EVs to the market, "it's very clear what direction this is all going into." He adds that the advancements in electric vehicles, in solar, wind, and batteries shows that "technology trumps politics any day of the week."

Matt Stucky, Chief Portfolio Manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, advises keeping track of the trends that have been driving Big Tech stocks. Stucky mentions the ongoing health of advertising, noting that Alphabet and Meta (META) have the opportunity to take advantage of the improving ad environment. Stucky continues by discussing how strong fundamentals are more relevant than valuations in the short run, considering the upcoming earnings and their influence over the market. He concedes, "It's not until you start to see revision trends rollover that’s where the valuation concerns really come into the investor mindset." When asked about where investors should look to invest their money within tech, Stucky notes that he is not advising clients to blindly dump money into mega-cap tech. Instead, he suggests keeping a long-term investment horizon while continuing to diversify their portfolio, using small-cap stocks as an example. Switching gears to CrowdStrike (CRWD) and cybersecurity as a whole, Stucky explains the prominence of security as a cemented trend year after year. He uses the recent crash as an example of the necessity of IT resilience and the potential for further spending in the IT sector.

"We've had a big rally in a lot of these stocks. I refer to six stocks as the Super Six.' It's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta [Platforms] (META), Netflix (NFLX), Spotify (SPOT), Trade Desk (TTD). They're all up 30 to 60% year to date. Having said that, it's hard to materially outperform if you're up that much year to date, off of reasonable valuations to begin the year, not off of beaten-down lows, which was the case last year. So I want to be highly selective here," Mahaney explains. He is bullish on Alphabet because of its product cycle and growth in its YouTube platform, also pointing to Uber (UBER) as his number two pick, "I think we just had some dislocation in the stock recently over fears of robotaxis and how that could disrupt ridesharing. I don't think it will. I think robotaxis will be part of the ridesharing solution." On the other hand, Mahaney does not have Amazon in his top three list of tech stocks despite maintaining its Buy rating. He explains, "I was a little concerned about some of the iffy retail sales data points that we've seen. April and May were weak. However, June came back gangbusters, so there may not be. There probably isn't a problem with Amazon retail..." Catch Catalysts' full interview with Mark Mahaney.

Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton guide investors through the final trading hour of Tuesday, August 6, talking to top economic minds and leading Wall Street experts.

While some on Wall Street are concerned about a recession, wondering if the Federal Reserve waited too long to make cuts, others may seem this as a buying opportunity. Wedbush Securities Managing Director, senior equity research analyst Dan Ives joins Market Domination to discuss the recent sell-off in tech and what investors need to know if they plan on buying the dip. Ives tells investors, "For Big Tech, these are the buying opportunities... these global sort of white-knuckle moments, you buy high quality, large-cap tech" Ives adds later, "Look at the fundamentals. I mean, we just came through a tech earnings season that was actually pretty robust relative to, I think, Big Tech, cloud, and AI. Look at Palantir (PLTR) last night, just another, you know, monster performance. So we're kind of looking at what are the fundamentals look like. Here in Asia, we don't see any issues in terms of demand and I think we hear this from Nvidia (NVDA) in the next few weeks. These are the opportunities if you're a believer like we are."

    <div class='news-section'><h2>News on stock symbol AMZN</h2><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Ulta faces challenges from Amazon, consumer loyalty</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-25 22:00:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Piper Sandler has downgraded Ulta Beauty (ULTA) from Overweight to Neutral. Piper Sandler senior research analyst Korinne Wolfmeyer joins Market Domination to discuss her reasoning behind the call and how it is faring against other big names in the beauty industry. Wolfmeyer points to Ulta's promotions as a "reaction to the competitive intensity we've seen over the past several months and even years, both from brick-and-mortar retail peers such as Sephora that's really ramped up its store count with its partnership with Kohl's (KSS), but also with online players like Amazon (AMZN) that's really ramped up its prestige beauty offering and seen a lot more brands feel comfortable selling on digital platforms like Amazon." She notes that this competition has placed Ulta under pressure, and that "there's a lot less confidence in the margin opportunity going forward." She adds that Amazon is a "threat to everybody," as it has a wide offering of products. Wolfmeyer explains that Ulta has a mass offering larger than Sephora, so it may be losing some share to Amazon. While Ulta's target demographic is broad-based, she argues that overall, customers are "diversifying where they're shopping, and they want to shop at all the different retailers. They don't want to stay loyal to just one." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Beauty 'captures' consumers in ways rivals haven't</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-25 21:20:09+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Piper Sandler senior research analyst Korinne Wolfmeyer joins Market Domination to discuss the state of beauty retail brands and some of her top picks in the cosmetics industry. "If a brand doesn't have exposure to the retailers or the areas that are gaining share, then they are going to lose," Wolfmeyer says. She notes that many beauty companies are increasingly offering their products in high-growth avenues, like on Amazon's e-commerce site (AMZN). She adds, "We're seeing the brands shift where they're selling and really going after where those high growth categories and distributors are." Wolfmeyer points to e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) as one of her top picks in the beauty industry, noting that the company has seen unprecedented growth and strong margins. She believes that investors are undervaluing the international opportunity for the company, as well as its ability to capture the consumer. "The consumer is becoming less loyal and so they need that newness. They need something constantly innovating and hitting them and really targeting them through all facets of marketing tactics. And that's what e.l.f. does," She explains that the company has "heavy innovation" and "very agile marketing strategies" that make it stand out against its competitors. E.l.f. Beauty is set to report earnings for its fiscal 2025 first quarter on Thursday, August 8.

Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Morning Brief to discuss the semiconductor industry's current state. Moorhead observes that due to the chip sector's strong momentum over the past year, "any hiccup, any rumor of something" can trigger a stock decline. He suggests this downturn presents an opportunity for investors to identify potential high-growth companies beyond industry giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Intel (INTC). Moorhead advises investors to "look at a mid-term and even... long-term approach of where those stocks are going or could go," highlighting companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM). Regarding industry trends, Moorhead notes that many companies are pivoting towards AI, often at the expense of other initiatives. "They want their IT groups to pivot to generative AI. And a lot of this is about FOMO, it's the fear of missing out," he explains. This shift in focus is creating a divide in the market: "That's why you see companies that aren't engaged in the generative AI wave are seeing very mixed results."

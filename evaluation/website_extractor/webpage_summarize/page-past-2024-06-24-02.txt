Meanwhile, Microsoft has also been in the spotlight, with its stock reaching an all-time high before experiencing a slight pullback. Analysts remain optimistic about Microsoft's future, particularly regarding its cloud services and AI initiatives. The companyâ€™s recent investment in AI firm G42 is viewed positively, especially as it distances itself from Huawei.

The European Union has charged Apple with violating the Digital Markets Act, alleging that its App Store practices hinder competition. Analysts believe that while Apple may need to adjust its practices, the long-term impact on its stock value will be minimal.

In the health sector, companies like Altimmune and Novo Nordisk are making strides, with positive trial results and significant investments in manufacturing capabilities for weight-loss drugs.

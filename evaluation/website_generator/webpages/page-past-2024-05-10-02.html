Some companies like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have pulled ahead, while others, like Apple (AAPL), have faced mounting challenges. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives joins The Morning Brief to discuss what he calls "the fourth industrial revolution" in AI and Apple's advances on the front. Ives states that Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference will be paramount for Apple: "I think it's probably the most important event for Apple that we've seen potentially in a decade because this is going to be [CEO Tim] Cook laying out the AI strategy on the services side for developers, what I believe is really the start of an AI app store in terms of how that's going to morph and then its proprietary AI technology in iPhone 16, which will launch in September."

Tens of thousands of dock workers could strike next week at cargo ports along the East and Gulf Coasts. The strike could have major implications for the US economy as it also adds to the mounting uncertainty around the 2024 presidential election. Yahoo Finance Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul breaks down how the Biden administration is handling the looming strike and how it could impact the election. Meanwhile, consumers may be wondering if holiday shopping could be impacted by the strike. Naveen Jaggi, JLL Americas president of retail, tells Yahoo Finance, “In terms of holiday product, [retailers] have their product in the States, they have their distribution centers or at the stores… Most of the items that are being sold, the toys, the electronics and the soft goods, clothings, that are pretty predominant when it comes to holiday sales, those come from Asia,” meaning they would not be affected by the port workers on the East and Gulf Coasts going on strike. Mercor CEO Brendan Foody joins the show to discuss how Mercor uses artificial intelligence to make the hiring process more efficient. Foody explains, “Mercor is able to automate all of those [HR] processes with [large language models (LLMs)] not only far more scalably but also far more effectively. We've processed over 300,000 candidates, conducted hundreds of thousands of verbal interviews asking nuanced questions about people's backgrounds, and matched thousands of people with jobs.” Mercor trains LLMs, predominantly OpenAI’s GPT series and Meta's (META) Llama models, on “all the proprietary data we have on candidates to best understand who's going to perform well at a given job, for what reasons,” Foody says. The Federal Reserve has officially kicked off its rate-cutting cycle as it eyes a 2% inflation target. But some economists are skeptical about whether a soft landing can actually be achieved. Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman analyzes whether the US economy has the right conditions for a soft landing. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer also breaks down his top takeaways from the trading day, from easing inflation to the small-cap (^RUT) rally.

This is the latest of a slew of tech companies who have been subject to regulatory overhand. RBC Capital Markets equity analyst Brad Erickson joins Catalysts to discuss why the regulatory challenges facing Big Tech companies should have little to no impact on investment strategies. Erickson explains that the Department of Justice is currently drafting a proposal for the judge in the default search case, outlining how they plan to "remedy Google's ability to secure search status" on smartphones. The DOJ has until December to submit this proposal, with the judge expected to rule by August 2025. However, Erickson notes that Google's planned appeal could extend the legal battle for several years. Due to this lengthy process, he believes Google's business "isn't fundamentally about to change in sort of a seismic way," making the stock attractive at current levels. Addressing the broader regulatory landscape across the tech sector, Erickson states, "Our kind of holistic view across the space, certainly for the companies we follow like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Meta (META) ... the businesses are so far down the road. The train has so far left the station that unwinding the technology and the intricacy and the complexity of what these companies have built to ... drive their businesses, I don't know if it's totally possible to unpack that."

RBC Capital Markets equity analyst Brad Erickson shares his outlook on how this kind of spending could impact big tech companies. Erickson believes that tech giants like Meta "are going to keep spending money on this stuff." With Meta revealing only a prototype to investors at it's Connect Conference, Erickson sees this as a positive sign for the company's upcoming quarterly results. Erickson notes a strong correlation between AI spending and revenue growth, stating, "management recognizes that they can't just go spend an unlimited amount of dollars unless the business is growing fast enough." "So long as those fundamental trends are good, it gives them license to go out and keep spending on this, and thus we kind of view the spending as the tip of the spear indicator. If you were to detect any sort of pullback, it probably comes from the fact that maybe revenue growth is slowing. We haven't seen that yet," Erickson explains.

If you look at the overall market, OpenAI no longer has a massive technology lead. If you look at what Meta (META) was talking about this week, they've provided their best model to the open source for free.” Windsor says the $150 billion price tag is “an optimistic scenario for a company where almost all of the founders have left. The key brains of the company left this week so that valuation looks incredibly risky to me.” He says OpenAI’s reported shift to a for-profit model is “an absolute must-have.” Windsor adds, “If you look at some of the term sheets that are going out, my suspicion is that there's a promise in there to turn into a proper for-profit company over the next year or so because, quite frankly, if it doesn't, then the company is not worth anything at all.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

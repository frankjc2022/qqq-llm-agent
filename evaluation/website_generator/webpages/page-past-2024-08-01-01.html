Both reports give insight into the state of the consumer domestically and abroad which is still under pressure from inflation. Maxim Group Managing Director and Senior Consumer Internet Analyst Tom Forte joined to discuss Apple's earnings and give insight into its performance in China. The major indexes (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC) closed lower as Wall Street digests hotter-than-expected jobless claims data and a soft US manufacturing print. Coinbase (COIN) posted second quarter earnings, reporting revenue that more than doubled from a year ago. Transactional revenue for the company did jump 138%, however, it missed the 141% Wall Street expectation. Fintech companies are also in the spotlight as major players such as Block (SQ) and MicroStrategy (MSTR) report their quarterly earnings. Both companies fell short on revenue expectations. Benchmark managing director & senior research analyst of fintech and digital assets Mark Palmer joined the show to discuss the fintech space and what investors can expect moving forward.

Apple showed off its AI software update at its latest WWDC. Could it spur an iPhone upgrade cycle? Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Asking For A Trend to break down Apple's latest quarterly report and how the company will operate moving forward. Forte points out: "I think the ultimate story for Apple is that there will be an upgrade cycle for iPhones, which is still the most important product, half their revenue. The question is how quickly will that start? Because there were headlines recently suggesting that they're going to have new hardware for consumers, assumingly in September, but they may have to wait for a software update to get Apple Intelligence to work." Forte has a Hold rating on the stock: "Because you're looking at a PE north of 30 times versus the big tech peers, more like 27.5. And when you compare the iPhone trends before the 5G, there was actually a lot more pent up demand for new iPhones leveraging 5G networks then I believe there's pent up demand for artificial intelligence." However, he points out a challenge for Apple: "When you look at Europe, which is about 25% of revenue and China, which is about 19% of revenue, it doesn't appear that they're going to be able to launch Apple Intelligence any time soon."

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened lower on Thursday amid the latest labor market data and increasing Middle East tensions. Initial jobless claims for the week ending September 28 rose to 225,000, slightly above the estimated 221,000. Oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) are continuing to spike as tensions boil between Israel and Iran. US stock markets are experiencing a period of heightened volatility, driven by a variety of factors including Hurricane Helene, the upcoming US presidential election, and escalating Middle East tensions. The Wealth Consulting Group's chief market strategist Talley Léger acknowledges that markets have been hit by numerous events that could potentially unsettle investors, questioning, "when are they perfectly certain?" However, he notes that such turbulence is a common occurrence in financial markets, adding that "through it all, the stock market has continued its inexorable march forward." Due to this dynamic, Léger advises investors to view market dips as potential buying opportunities. The rotation out of Big Tech has become evident, with the standout "Magnificent Seven" (AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, GOOGL, AMZN, META, MSFT, NVDA) names no longer being the market frontrunners they once were. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza notes that the Magnificent Seven's market leadership "hit an abrupt stop" in mid-July, fueled by the unwinding of the yen carry trade. While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes "it's too early to give up" on the Magnificent Seven. Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt’s senior research analyst, outlines his bullish stance on Meta. “The growth supports the multiple… The bigger backdrop, we think, is that people are getting more comfortable with Meta’s strategic positioning. Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.” Crockett explains. The Hang Seng (^HSI) ended the day lower after 13 straight days of gains following a wave of stimulus measures aimed at bolstering the country's struggling economy. While JPMorgan has warned investors about the risks of chasing the rally given its high valuations, KraneShares CIO Brendan Ahern argues it's still in the "very, very early innings." With more information about fiscal policy expected from Chinese officials, the rally could continue. He adds, "Instead of looking through the rearview mirror, let's look through the windshield."

Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.” Crockett explains. He says, “Frankly, I think the big worry on the stock historically has been spending, right? In particular, their investments in their reality segment, which, I think, are overdone and are not going to generate a return that we think pencils out commensurate to the investment. But they are executing better. The devices that they were showing off at their recent Meta Connect [are] more resonant with the consumer than even what Apple is doing right now. And their Ray-Ban glasses could actually be something of a hit this Christmas.” Despite the analyst's view that Meta's investments in the reality segment won't necessarily pay off, he explains Meta can afford the project. "The amazing thing is that they don't ever have to make money in this. We don't assume they do. For the earnings growth to be impressive enough and to support the equity from here, you know, if they did, that'd be a huge upside, there. You know, we think on pace to lose 17 billion-ish this year in operating profit on reality. And that's going to be more than they lost last year. They probably lost 60 billion cumulatively on this. And yet they're growing EPS." Crockett says Meta is "so strong in the advertising marketing that they can support this basically dreamer's tax on reality, and you can still make a great argument for the stock."He explains, "These guys were growing their advertising revenues at a 20% year-over-year pace in the quarter that was reported for June. We think they'll keep growing at close to that pace in the September ending quarter. That's going to put them up at the very fastest growers in advertising. Nearly twice the growth rate of Google and right on top of what Amazon is doing with their new ad push and not too far behind the connected TV darling, the Trade Desk... These guys are large. They're growing rapidly, and that's a very profitable growth stream." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes "it's too early to give up" on the Magnificent Seven. "While we don't expect them to continue to see just outsized performance, it's tough to see the market continue to grind higher without their participation. I think a broadening is good, but I actually want these leaders to be able to participate at the same time," he explains. Regarding the Magnificent Seven as a whole, Mazza explains they were coined that name because they were all performing at the same rate and outperforming the rest of the markets with a strong lead. However as that trend has begun to waver, Mazza identifies Tesla as the most concerning among the names.

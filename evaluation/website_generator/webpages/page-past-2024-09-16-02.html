Roy tells Yahoo Finance that investors are worried about when Big Tech companies will see the payoff of their AI investments. Another key chip investor concern is the sustainability of the increased capital expenditures (capex) spending to invest into AI and where the spending will shift after data centers are built. Nvidia stands out as a major benefactor of the AI boom. Despite recent volatility, the chipmaker's stock has more than doubled since the start of 2024. The analyst tells the Market Domination team that Nvidia’s “checks have been solid” and “it's not just Blackwell” as demand for the company's Hopper GPUs is also holding strong.

Feeney does not expect small caps to be at risk of more fiscal policy changes this year. However, as the election remains tight between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, she argues that both sides have "pretty unattractive policies." She explains, "It's unlikely that both sides of the aisle would support an increase in the corporate tax rate, no matter who gets elected. So I think that's a low-risk situation. Tariff policy is more concerning, particularly for small businesses, because a lot of the time they're sourcing their inputs from abroad and often from cheap suppliers abroad." She points to Broadcom (AVGO) as a "core holding" at Advisors Capital Management and a good opportunity for investors, arguing that it has "risen through the ranks through all the acquisitions that their leadership has made over the last several years. But it's still not as well known as, say, a Nvidia (NVDA) or some of the other bigger guys like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN)." She also highlights its mix of assets, from software to hardware. "We think it's going to be good for the long term. Other companies like Nvidia may be a little bit more volatile, but also a lot of growth ahead of it. So we like that one as well," Feeney adds.

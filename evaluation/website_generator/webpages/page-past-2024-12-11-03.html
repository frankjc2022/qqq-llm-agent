"People don't want to be on the wrong side of what has been, for two years, an incredibly impressive trade," he tells Yahoo Finance. Investors are returning to the Magnificent 7 names because these stocks provide both offensive and defensive strategies in the current market landscape. "These companies as a whole... really have impressive operating leverage," Mazza notes. With uncertainty surrounding potential tariffs and inflation in the upcoming year, investors are seeking companies that can "power through" economic challenges, which increasingly points them toward the Magnificent Seven. Despite this focus, Mazza adds: "I think there is a general sentiment that the economy is okay, and we have so much positive investor sentiment right now, and that to me is what's really pushing the market higher."

Intelligent Alpha founder and CEO Doug Clinton joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to take a closer look at what sent Apple stock higher and where the iPhone maker stands in the AI era. Clinton says there are two things driving Apple stock higher. He explains, "First of all, I think the Magnificent Seven in general, we've had a pretty good period really since the election. We got past sort of the uncertainty about direction right at the top level for the country." "The second piece is specific to Apple. If you look at their business, I think that the iPhone numbers, and investors seem to realize this, for next year, are kind of de-risked. I mean, expectations are low... There's really no expectation for AI adding much of anything to Apple over the next year." On the reports of Apple working on a chip, Clinton says "Any company that is playing in the AI space that has over $1 billion market cap, we think, they have to develop their own silicon. It's just a matter of time for any of those companies who aren't doing it. Apple was obviously always involved in making their own silicon for their devices. Now, they're bringing that into the server and doing it for their particular use case in AI. I think it's a smart move by them, somewhat predictable, but it also shows, I think, that they are serious about AI."

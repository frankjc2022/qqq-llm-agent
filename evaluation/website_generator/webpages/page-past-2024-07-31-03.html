The e-commerce giant's capital investments - mostly for building cloud and generative AI infrastructure - is expected to have risen 43% in the second quarter to $16.41 billion, according to LSEG data.  The steep spending is also expected to pressure Amazon's margins, outweighing benefits from cost cuts and supply chain efficiencies that are aiding the retail unit's profitability.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Amazon Now Bears Responsibility for Recall of Third-Party Items</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-31 18:05:41+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>A new decision and order from the U.S.'s consumer safety watchdog says Amazon is more than just a logistics partner and bears responsibility for consumer safety.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Why Amazon Stock Popped on Wednesday</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-31 17:47:27+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Reports suggest the company is expanding its already significant reach.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Match Group (MTCH) Q2 Earnings Meet Estimates, Revenues Up Y/Y</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-31 17:29:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Match Group's (MTCH) second-quarter results benefit from strength in Tinder and Hinge despite sluggish growth in total payers.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Groupon (GRPN) Reports Loss in Q2, Revenues Decrease Y/Y</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-31 17:23:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Groupon's (GRPN) second-quarter results reflect sluggishness in travel and goods markets.

Winthrop Capital Management portfolio manager Luke Stone joins Catalysts to discuss these market dynamics. Stone observes a "rotation narrative" in the markets, where the Magnificent Seven stocks' valuations are considered too lofty, making it "very hard to hit" expectations. As this trend continues, he suggests investors may reduce their positions in these stocks and look elsewhere in the broader market for attractive opportunities. "Investors are growing a little bit impatient that we're kicking the can down the road," Stone notes, referring to Big Tech names as investors wait for AI investments to yield returns. He cautions, "all of this CapEx [capital expenditures] is great today, but if you don't have a customer base to execute on in a year from now, or if that customer base declines from worsening economic scenarios, you're going to run into issues down the road."

Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Asking For A Trade to give insight into the tech sector, the AI trade, and what it means for Big Tech moving forward into the earnings season. Moorhead reiterates his thought from a previous interview: "I really laid out a thesis that says the infrastructure build-out is going to continue for at least another year and maybe 18 months, and that's driven primarily by the downstream FOMO, or the fear of missing out, from those enterprise SaaS providers. Meta, who clearly showed that they're investing hardcore because they have to. If you are not investing in your competitors, you could be set back potentially a decade here. Moorhead is also looking at the long-term valuations of AI-adjacent software companies and chip designers like ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARM) He ends with his thoughts that Nvidia (NVDA) has "at least another 12 months to run. We saw TSMC (TSM), where Nvidia does all of their manufacturing, they're basically sold out through 2025 and into 2026. We just heard from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta that that they're putting the pedal to the metal on this. And all of this is goodness for Nvidia."

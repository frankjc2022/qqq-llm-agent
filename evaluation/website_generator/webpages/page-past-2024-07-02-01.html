As Americans kick off their holiday weekend, AAA Travel senior vice president Paula Twidale breaks down what Americans can expect from July Fourth travel. Twidale explains that American airports are gearing up for a record 70.9 million people traveling for the holiday, revealing that the pent-up pandemic-era travel demand isn't over: "Consumers are not willing to give up the respite they deserve," she says. The Pacific Northwest, theme parks, and urban cities such as New York and Chicago are particularly popular domestic destinations, Twidale notes. However, she adds that international travel is equally high. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed at record highs in Tuesday's session. Jared Blikre breaks down his three biggest takeaways from the trading day: Tesla shares closing above $200, market concentration topping the 1929 peak, and the dip in stock volatility. Rising home prices and high mortgage rates are shutting out would-be US homebuyers. Angi co-founder Angie Hicks explains that Americans who would have thought about moving are now thinking about renovation. According to Angi's home spending reports, bathrooms are consistently in the top five renovation projects, while kitchens are in the top 10. Outdoor remodeling remains popular even in post-pandemic times, she adds. Seana Smith joins the show to analyze a new Wells Fargo chart showing the potential rebalancing of earnings growth in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Wells Fargo notes that earnings growth will broaden beyond the "Magnificent 7," while participation and profitability outside of tech and communication services will also broaden. Finally, Apple (AAPL) has secured an observer role on OpenAI's board, according to a Bloomberg report. The seat will go to Phil Schiller, Apple's former marketing chief, who will be critical in providing Apple with key insight into OpenAI. Schiller will be allowed to attend board meetings but will not be able to vote or exercise any other director powers.

The tech giant has secured an observer role on OpenAI's board, according to a Bloomberg report. The seat will go to Phil Schiller, Apple's former marketing chief, who will be critical in providing Apple with key insight into OpenAI. Schiller will be allowed to attend board meetings but will not be able to vote or exercise any other director powers. This move comes after Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June that it would begin integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices.

The labor market is in focus ahead of the June jobs report scheduled to be released Friday morning, July 5. Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti comes onto the show to talk about the European Union's (EU) latest regulatory battles against Big Tech titans Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) under its Digital Markets Act (DMA). TD Bank Global Head of FX and EM Strategy Mark McCormick joins Catalysts in-studio to discuss the influence the Fed's interest rate journey and the 2024 US presidential election could have on the US dollar.

Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as "gatekeepers." Meta was identified by the Commission as a "gatekeeper" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, "I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model." He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a "slap on the wrist" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): "Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not. To me, it's more important, not that the fines are imposed, but the behavior of firms changes up-front because you don't want to fine people after they drive too fast. You want people to start slowing down." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

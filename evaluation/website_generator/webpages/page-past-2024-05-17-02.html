One of the chip giant's competitors, AMD (AMD), has just partnered with Microsoft (MSFT) to offer its products to Microsoft's cloud computing customers. Wedbush Equity Research SVP Matt Bryson and Truist Securities Managing Director William Stein join Market Domination to give insight into what investors should expect from Nvidia's earnings, how AMD stands in the sector, and how investors should navigate the chip sectors. Stein argues that Nvidia's short-term future is most likely successful, but uncertainty mounts down the line: "I think certainly they're going to beat this quarter. And I think they're going to beat in the out quarter guide as well. But I think the real question is what happens through this year and into next year's numbers. Does the company give us an indication that we're going to continue to see growth and very strong demand, both for units and for integrated systems, where the company is getting the growth from?"

TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Market Domination to discuss the move and what it could signal for the tech company's future. "It's an evolution of what Microsoft is doing on their gaming business in general," O'Donnell says of the move. He adds that the Game Pass subscription service has already seen success as subscription models gain popularity. "It's all about getting more subscribers," O'Donnell notes, comparing Game Pass to Netflix in its consistent push to gain and retain subscribers with new offerings. Microsoft's Build conference, a developer-focused event, will be held next week. At this event, O'Donnell expects to hear more about Microsoft's artificial intelligence initiatives and emphasizes the importance of staying a competitor in the market: "This is the year when AI really starts to have an impact. And then, eventually, we start to see even more of a bottom-line financial impact. We've started to see it. I expect we're going to be seeing more of that over the next 12 to 18 months."

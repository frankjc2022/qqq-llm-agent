(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced new data center components designed to support the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation and customers’ evolving needs. These capabilities combine innovations in power, cooling, and hardware design to create a more energy efficient data center that will underpin further customer innovation.

AWS, Amazon's cloud business, unveiled several updates to its data center infrastructure to ensure it can meet customers' AI needs. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley sits down with AWS vice president of infrastructure Prasad Kalyanaraman to discuss the announcements and what investors need to know about AWS' AI efforts. Kalyanaraman outlines four key focus areas of AWS' work: design simplification, power, cooling, and capacity. "We've done a ton of improvements in terms of simplification of our electrical and mechanical design that will improve the availability for our customers even more," he tells Yahoo Finance. "The second part of it is that generative AI requires a meaningful amount of power for these racks and for these chips, and we've been innovating on our power delivery design to these servers as well." "[The] third part is our cooling design," the AWS vice president says, adding, "We've innovated in such a way that we can retrofit our existing data centers for liquid cooling as well as air cooling. "Finally, our improvements in mechanical and electrical efficiency, to the tune of about 40% to 46% or so, has actually improved the amount of capacity we can deliver for our customers in the exact same data center." Ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) official launch of its new AI chip, Blackwell, Kalyanaraman talks about AWS' ongoing partnership with Nvidia and how the latest chip fits into the company's AI push. "The latest set of chips from Nvidia, which are the Blackwell processors, do require liquid cooling, and so we've been innovating in a way such that we can run liquid cooling infrastructure in addition to air cooling infrastructure."

Check out chip and small-cap stocks.</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-12-02 16:15:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>US stocks (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are trading near record highs ahead of the new year. How should investors position their portfolios in 2025? Bokeh Capital Partners founder and chief investment officer Kimberly Forrest joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share her 2025 portfolio repositioning strategy, focusing on semiconductor stocks and small-cap allocation. "I would look at that super semiconductor space and make some adjustments," Forrest tells Yahoo Finance, explaining, "It feels like semiconductors that are targeted on AI seem very overweight, and you should take a look at that." Names like Nvidia (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer Company (TSM), and Broadcom (AVGO) are among some of the top year-to-date gainers in the chip space. The strategist highlights potential opportunities in small-caps with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion. "Those mid-size companies are kind of forgotten recently and they're also misunderstood." She adds, "A lot of the lore on Wall Street says that mid-cap companies and small-cap companies mostly serve where they are founded in the US, and I disagree with that. I think a lot of the mid-caps are global companies... and I think those are the ones that you should be on the lookout for."

Spear Invest founder and CIO Ivana Delevska joins Market Domination to give insight into the current performance of the tech sector (XLK) and inform investors know what to keep in mind moving forward. Deleveska argues that Big Tech isn't going anywhere because, to truly implement AI in these businesses, it will take considerable investments.  Using Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms' (META) products as examples, she states: "As we go forward, it's going to take 2 to 3 years to see real applications come through. We are already seeing it on the early side with customer service and productivity improvement tools that are really leveraging the large language models, but the next level, the next layer of opportunity, will be in the physical, like robotics, autonomous driving, and that's going to take a little bit longer to play out. Nevertheless, you do need to make the investments today in compute to be able to advance these applications even a little bit.

Wedbush senior equity analyst Dan Ives joins Market Domination to discuss the call and how other Big Tech players are fairing in the AI race. "The AI revolution's here. And when I look at the next step, the use cases, Palantir, I think, is going to really be the one that's front and center in a lot of these deals," Ives argues, calling the company the "Messi of AI." He points to IP (intellectual property) conversion as a major growth area alongside its commercial and government businesses. He adds, "I don't know how you could have a basket of AI stocks and just dismiss Palantir." Broadening the conversation, Ives expects a "massive tech earnings season" for semiconductors: "There's no denying this AI revolution is probably the biggest tech trend we've seen in the last 40, 50 years." Apple (AAPL) is the latest player to enter the AI game, announcing its plans to integrate OpenAI's large-language model into its platforms. Ives states that despite skeptics, the new AI abilities are leading to rising demand for the iPhone 16.

US stocks (DJI, IXIC, GSPC) opened Thursday's session mixed, with the Nasdaq Composite ready to recoup its losses from Wednesday's chip stock selloff. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) rose in early trading on Thursday after posting better-than-expected second quarter results and raising its full-year revenue growth outlook. As Wall Street heads into the second half of the year, Annex Wealth Management chief economist and strategist Brian Jacobsen term anticipates market drivers to be "broken into two different parts" for late 2024: the Fed and the election. "Between now and September, it's likely more focused on the Fed. We will get distracted by politics, but really until we get closer to say end of September, beginning of October, when the polls are going to get a little bit more accurate, we think that those are just going to be like pockets of volatility," Jacobsen explains. "The 'Trump trade' came back in vogue with a vengeance over the last week or so. But that could kind of simmer down a little bit." Peak summer travel is underway, and despite record travel, United Airlines (UAL) revealed mixed second quarter earnings results and disappointing third quarter earnings guidance. Alaska Air Group's (ALK) stock fell Thursday morning following its second quarter earnings, disclosing full-year profit forecasts also below expectations. TD Cowen vice president of equity research Tom Fitzgerald explains, "The game changed a lot... the cost convergence is just the ultra low-cost carriers, they're just at such a disadvantaged point competitive wise, and... think people coming out of the pandemic are much more willing to pay for a more pleasant onboard experience, to pay for a more reliable product, to earn loyalty or to earn miles in an airline where they can redeem to go to Europe or something versus just another low cost, leisure, no-frills carrier." Pharmaceutical stocks are slipping Thursday as shares of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) dip despite the company raising its full-year profit forecast and revealing its medical-device segment saw sales 12% year-over-year in the second quarter. Similarly, shares of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis (NVS) are falling despite raising its full-year profit guidance after topping second quarter earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is out with a mix of retail calls. The firm's analyst team is bullish on Gap (GPS), upgrading the retail stock from Equal Weight to Overweight, explaining the stock offers "among the greatest fundamental recapture opportunities." On the other hand, Morgan Stanley downgraded Foot Locker (FL) to Underweight from Equal Weight and slashed its price target to $18 from $24 due to a weakening sales performance from Nike (NKE).

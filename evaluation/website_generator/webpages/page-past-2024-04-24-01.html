Recently, reports have shown that iPhone sales have slumped in China. Is Apple up for the challenge to reinvigorate its position in international markets and how will all this manifest in its May 2 earnings release? TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Apple's largest problems in the domestic US market and abroad, and how the iPhone maker might go about solving them. "Between the iPhone sales, between the geopolitical issues in China, which is still a very big market for them, and now they're having to do a little bit more of what the Chinese government is requesting, Huawei is getting stronger in China. There's nationalistic movements there to try and pull some of the US companies out. The car project was canceled, which I think, in the long run, was the right thing to do, but it could have been interesting earlier if they kind of figured out a different path," O'Donnell lists off.

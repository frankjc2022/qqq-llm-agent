In 2023, the tech juggernaut generated over $575 billion in revenue, boasting more than 200 million Amazon Prime members worldwide. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into some of the company's biggest moments. 1994 Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington. It was originally an online bookstore designed to compete with Barnes & Noble (BNED). 1997 On May 15, 1997, Amazon went public via IPO at $18 per share, giving it a valuation of $300 million. 1998 Amazon began selling CDs, marking the start of its effort to become a shopping Goliath. 2005 The company launched Amazon Prime, a $79 per year membership with free two-day shipping on eligible orders. 2006 Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS). The platform would go on to become the top cloud computing platform, ahead of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and one of Amazon’s most successful businesses. 2011 The company rebranded its video service as Amazon Instant Video with access to 5,000 movies and TV shows for Prime members. 2014 Amazon acquired the video game streaming website Twitch for $970 million. 2017 Amazon acquired high-end supermarket chain Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. It has since integrated the two companies, offering discounts to Prime members. 2018 On September 4, 2018, Amazon became just the second US company ever to reach a $1 trillion market cap, after Apple (AAPL) reached it earlier in the year. 2020 Amazon's sales and profits surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, as consumers turned to online shopping. Its total sales increased 38% year-over-year to $386.1 billion, and net income increased 83% to $21.3 billion. 2021 Founder Jeff Bezos announced that he would step down from his role as CEO and be succeeded by AWS CEO Andy Jassy. 2024 Amazon was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing drugstore giant Walgreens (WBA). The company continues to evolve, investing billions in AI startup Anthropic, developing more smart home products, and launching an AI shopping assistant named Rufus. It’s safe to say Amazon is a staple of the digital age.

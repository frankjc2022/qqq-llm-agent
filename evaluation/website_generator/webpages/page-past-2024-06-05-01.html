The show kicks off with an analysis of the ADP Employment Report, which fell short of expectations. Brad breaks down the report's details, explaining what it measures and its significance in gauging the overall health of the economy. To provide further insights, ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson shares her perspective on what the report reveals about the current state of the economy. The focus then shifts to oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F), which saw declines following OPEC+'s decision to extend production cuts. VettaFi's Head of Research Todd Rosenbluth shares his expertise on investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a means of navigating the volatility in the commodity market.  Looking ahead, the episode explores the highly anticipated Apple (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) beginning on June 10. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley joins the show to discuss the expectations surrounding the conference, particularly in terms of innovation and new AI offerings.

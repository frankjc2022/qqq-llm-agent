The major market averages (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) closed just below their flatlines as stocks eyed second quarter earnings from Magnificent Seven members Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Google's parent Alphabet posted second quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company reported earnings per share of $1.89 versus an estimate of $1.84. Revenue of $84.74 billion topped estimates of $84.37 billion, while revenue ex-TAC of $71.36 billion was better than the Street's expectations of $70.7 billion. CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino characterizes the results as "solid," but notes that the it fell short of the significant beats investors have come to expect from Big Tech, describing it as "more of an in-line type quarter." Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.52, missing Street expectations of $0.60. Free cash flow also fell short, $1.34 billion versus the estimated $1.92 billion. Revenue, however, was a beat of $25.50 billion versus the estimated $24.63 billion. Gross margin of 18% was better than the expected 17.4%. As investors wait to hear more about Tesla's robotaxi plans after delaying the launch, RBC Capital Markets global autos analyst Tom Narayan argues, "I know they said it had some design issues, but I do wonder, and many investors wonder, if it has to do with them trying to get regulatory approvals to launch a service similar to, let's say, Waymo or Cruise have." He says that investors "want something real" on this front, rather than "a bunch of PowerPoint slides." He continues, "When they eventually unveil this, I think they'll want details on timing, profitability, and they'll want something within six months to a year, not ten years down the road."

While Apple has struggled with iPhone sales in recent history — especially in China's consumer market — could this new tech help improve sales? Needham & Co. Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin joins Catalysts to give insight into why she believes it's too early to tell if this announcement will truly change anything for Apple from a sales perspective. "I do not think that will play out in the current iPhone [16] that gets launched in September, especially because you saw today the headline was that Apple needs a large language model in China because China doesn't allow any of the large language models that are sitting in America to be used," Martin claims. "So none of the gen. AI [generative AI] stuff they announced are represented are allowed in China and that's 20% of iPhone sales. So I think this cycle is too early. So we think actually estimates will not exceed Wall Street consensus this year." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

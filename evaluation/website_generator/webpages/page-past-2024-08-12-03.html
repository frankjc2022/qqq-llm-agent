As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his "fundamentally-driven" approach rather than being "event-driven," suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. "I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings," Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this "the big story that is going unnoticed right now." Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to "a see-saw." On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while "everything else in the global equity markets" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a "once in a generation opportunity."

Looking forward, chip stocks look to regain momentum after August volatility, but can they capture their previous heights? KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to give insight into the chip sector and how semiconductor stocks may perform as Big Tech leans harder into AI. "I think if you look at the sell-off over the last several weeks related to the chip sector, maybe more specifically to Nvidia, I think one, you had some concerns about maybe hyper scaler CapEx [capital expenditures] getting to kind of peak levels, but I think those were largely addressed later when you had comments coming out from Microsoft (MSFT) that it's still seeing phenomenal demand on the AI front, and it's actually supply-constrained," Vinh says. "The second factor is there's some concerns out there that its next-generation Blackwell product could be delayed. I wouldn't find that too surprising." In terms of how the stock may perform, Vinh believes Nvidia will "beat and raise, we don't think near-term demand is going to be an issue at all." Nvidia is scheduled to report second quarter earnings on Wednesday, August 28. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

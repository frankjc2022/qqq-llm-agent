Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton guide investors through the final trading hour of Tuesday, August 6, talking to top economic minds and leading Wall Street experts. Rosenberg Research founder and president David Rosenberg discusses why he believes a recession is "not too far away" after the stock market reacted the way it did after last week's July jobs report. As part of today's installment of Good Buy or Goodbye, Thornburg Investment Management portfolio manager Emily Leveille lays out the arguments for her latest stock trades: buy Globant (GLOB), but avoid LVMH (MC.PA). Zoetis (ZTS) CFO Wetteny Joseph joins the Market Domination team to talk about the pet health company's latest earnings and how pet owners are choosing to spend for animal healthcare costs.

While some on Wall Street are concerned about a recession, wondering if the Federal Reserve waited too long to make cuts, others may seem this as a buying opportunity. Wedbush Securities Managing Director, senior equity research analyst Dan Ives joins Market Domination to discuss the recent sell-off in tech and what investors need to know if they plan on buying the dip. Ives tells investors, "For Big Tech, these are the buying opportunities... these global sort of white-knuckle moments, you buy high quality, large-cap tech" Ives adds later, "Look at the fundamentals. I mean, we just came through a tech earnings season that was actually pretty robust relative to, I think, Big Tech, cloud, and AI. Look at Palantir (PLTR) last night, just another, you know, monster performance. So we're kind of looking at what are the fundamentals look like. Here in Asia, we don't see any issues in terms of demand and I think we hear this from Nvidia (NVDA) in the next few weeks. These are the opportunities if you're a believer like we are."

A potential remedy for Google to avoid antitrust actions could involve terminating the agreement, which makes its search engine a default on Apple devices, Wall Street analysts said on Tuesday.  Google pays Apple $20 billion annually, or about 36% of what it earns from search advertising made through the Safari browser, for the privilege, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.</div></div></div><div class='news-section'><h2>News on AAPL</h2><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Apple Stock Falls Amid Broad Selloff as Berkshire Hathaway Trims Stake Again - Investopedia</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: Mon, 05 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT</div><div class='news-description'>Apple Stock Falls Amid Broad Selloff as Berkshire Hathaway Trims Stake Again  Investopedia</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Apple (AAPL) Stock Earnings Preview: Magnificent 7 Selloff? - tastylive</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: Thu, 25 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT</div><div class='news-description'>Apple (AAPL) Stock Earnings Preview: Magnificent 7 Selloff?  tastylive </div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Buffett Cuts Apple Stake: What Should You Do With AAPL Stock? - Yahoo Finance</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: Tue, 06 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT</div><div class='news-description'>Buffett Cuts Apple Stake: What Should You Do With AAPL Stock?  Yahoo Finance</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Wall Street Analysts Think Apple (AAPL) Is a Good Investment: Is It? - Nasdaq</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: Mon, 05 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT</div><div class='news-description'>Wall Street Analysts Think Apple (AAPL) Is a Good Investment: Is It?  Nasdaq</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Is Apple Stock A Buy After Record Stock Buyback Announcement?

Telluride Legal Strategies founder Rob Rosenberg joins Asking for a Trend with Josh Lipton to discuss what to expect from the company's Christmas Day NFL coverage. Rosenberg says he doesn't expect the tech issues that happened with Netflix's Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight. "Streaming is a complex process ... [and] sometimes when demand is huge, it overpowers the system, it overwhelms it. You've got delays, and problems arise. But I would not bet against Netflix. I think that the timing of the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight was a great test case for Christmas Day." "The best way to get good at streaming at scale is to just do it. There were some hiccups in the fight last month, but I think that they're going to nail it on Christmas Day with these games," he adds. "Up until now, there's been fewer horses in the race [to air sports content], now, with the streamers getting into it," Rosenberg says, adding, "I think that as they develop this expertise where they can deliver these games in a premium experience that people have come to expect from their football, I think that we're going to see more and more competition for these rights as they become available. Watch the video above to learn more about how streamers like Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video, Comcast's (CMCSA) Peacock, and Disney (DIS) are joining Netflix in its push to host sports content.

Kenwell says retail investors are "optimistic" but "realistic" for the new year. "They're looking to gain more exposure to crypto in 2025. They're looking to gain more exposure to equities in 2025. But they're also looking to raise some cash here," he says, later adding: "I think they're being prudent, but also, you know, keeping one foot in at least is so they keep getting taking advantage of, you know, more gains to come in 2025 if that is the case." The analyst reports that the survey found retail investors to prefer the financials sector and big-cap tech, including Magnificent Seven names and other artificial intelligence (AI) plays.

"We think we're headed toward a period of rapid technological shifts. Historically, whenever that's happened, significant opportunities have been unlocked," Crowley explains. He believes AI's economic impact could rival that of the internet revolution. Crowley identifies "real-world AI" as the sector's next evolution, highlighting two key investment opportunities. First, he points to "entirely new product-category" companies like Tesla (TSLA), which is advancing autonomous driving technology. Second, he sees potential in established companies with "existing business lines," such as Amazon (AMZN), which can leverage AI to enhance operational efficiency. "We're kind of trying to move into the next phase here of where we see AI playing out," he tells Yahoo Finance.

His top pick for 2025 and large-cap stocks, in fact, is rideshare giant Uber Technologies (UBER). "When we looked at Uber we see a couple of things: Number one, an outsized risk reward. Our fair value is $96... with we believe not much downside. The stock also has gotten caught up in a lot of debates in the last few months... [including] the debate around Waymo and what will happen to autonomous vehicles over the next three, five, seven, ten years," Sheridan tells Catalyst hosts Seana Smith and Brian Sozzi. Sheridan also shares his favorable outlook on Magnificent Seven players Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META). “Amazon, among those three, probably has the most upside. We believe Amazon still has exposure to the widest collection of the secular themes you want exposure to in the digital economy,” Sheridan says. “Media consumption habits, shopping, cloud computing, AI — these are all themes you want a lot of exposure to."

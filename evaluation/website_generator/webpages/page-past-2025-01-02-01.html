Bajarin names several of the typical players in the AI semiconductor space contributing to infrastructure, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell Technology (MRVL). "A ton of growth still going on the infrastructure side, so I imagine that that that will continue," Bajarin states. "We're going to continue to see a tremendous amount of demand for compute, that's not going away. But I think what I'm looking for in 2025 is the software monetization of those stocks." Bajarin also weighs in on the reported boost in productivity from executives after deploying AI agents across several industries, as well as what is to be expected on cloud computing spend and Apple's (AAPL) AI-enabled computers and smart devices.

Gautam Mukunda, Yale School of Management executive fellow and author of "Picking Presidents," joins Market Domination Overtime to analyze the growing corporate support for Trump's second term. Mukunda asserts that companies are being pragmatic in their support for Trump, pointing out Trump's historical willingness to use federal government power against those he perceives as political enemies or threats. He references Trump's previous conflicts with Jeff Bezos during his first term, when Trump targeted Bezos over his ownership of the Washington Post. Mukunda observes, "Trump is very transactional, and these companies are making a transaction." However, he warns, "When you have said 'I will pay up if you threaten me,' the incentive you have created is to keep threatening you in order to get more payouts," adding that these companies "will learn the hard way."

The retail sector (XRT) and tech sector (XLK) being among the spaces that saw a mixed bag of results from its top players. MarketGauge.com chief strategist Michele Schneider joins Market Domination to give insight into what investors need to know about the current market environment following earnings, underlining how best to trade on technicals from each of these industries. Schneider explains the consumer play as retailers deliver winning or lagging quarterly results amid price-conscious shoppers, while the retail sector is "very close to a major breakout." Turning to tech, Schneider details hidden opportunities to watch and how investors should be "treading water." She names Eli Lilly (LLY) as one other stock that is "treading water" but in a different manner than tech. Eli Lilly could potentially see $150 to $200 more in this stock coming up, Schneider says.

Heading into the final hours of trading for the month, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) are poised for wins for the month. As the calendar turns to September, investor attention now shifts toward a potential interest rate cut proposed by the Federal Reserve Commerce Street Capital CEO and President Dory Wiley joins Market Domination to speak about the latest market moves and what to expect from the Fed's upcoming FOMC policy meeting. "The economy's kind of hanging in there coming into what I expect to be a choppy fall," Wiley says, who adds that he expects "profit taking, especially for the next couple of weeks going into September 18." "And once that Fed cuts that rate, which I think will be a positive for the market, I think you'll see a lot of institutions continue to profit take, particularly out of tech and rolling into other value-based opportunities. And then that choppiness continuing into the fall at best, unless something else happens to create a bigger downdraft," Wiley explains. While investors reacted to Nvidia earnings  (NVDA) this week with a slight sell-off, Dory has a message for retail investors “You buy it for the long term, that one you buy for the long term."

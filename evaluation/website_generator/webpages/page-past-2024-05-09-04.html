"Will they be able to sell (generative AI) software to businesses and consumers well enough to cover what they're paying for all the infrastructure — and make some money for investors on the other end?" said Jeremy C. Owens, tech editor at MarketWatch, on Investor's Business Daily's "Investing with IBD" podcast.

As these companies realize potential in their data sets and money to be made from digital advertising, they continue to vie for any competitive edge they can find. TikTok is an incredibly powerful platform that sees huge volumes of user traffic which in turn can drive consumer growth for companies, both large brands and small businesses. With the US leveraging a potential ban against TikTok if its parent company ByteDance doesn't divest from it, how can these tech giants stir up even tighter competition if a ban ends up going through? MikMak CEO Rachel Tipograph joins Catalysts to discuss her company's findings from ad revenue data and the power TikTok holds in the business world. Tipograph explains: "TikTok is typically now around our second most trafficked social platform. It goes Meta, then TikTok, then an environment like YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP), and then X is irrelevant. I share this because I'm not seeing brands pull back from TikTok. I think right now they're actually trying to put their pedal on the gas while TikTok's around. TikTok is an amazing channel to drive consumer growth. We're seeing it in beauty, we're starting to see it in grocery." She then affirms: "If TikTok was to go away, Meta would win, YouTube would win, CTV would win. TikTok is really a play of brand awareness and video, and so those dollars would just get reallocated."

Big Tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have all announced major investments in building out their AI infrastructures. While the plans show confidence in the future, will they actually pay off? Bokeh Capital Partners Founder and Chief Investment Officer Kimberly Forrest joins Morning Brief to give insight into the AI sector and discuss which companies are in the best position to actually benefit from AI investments. When asked about when investors will see real payoffs from these big investments from AI, Forrest says: "Building out the data center is part of it, then you're going to have companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), and everybody else is going to pile in and start using the generative AI to maybe increase productivity... And I would look for who do you think is most likely to benefit from using generative AI. And we've just mentioned them, right? Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, and to me Microsoft is really probably [in] the best position because they'll get people to actually pay for it, not just advertising dollars."

This development comes as the semiconductor sector undergoes a sector-wide correction. Bernstein Managing Director and Senior Analyst Stacy Rasgon joins Market Domination to provide insights into this situation. Rasgon acknowledges that while the chip sector is undergoing a correction, "outside of AI" the industry has not been performing well. He notes that other segments of the sector, such as automotive, data centers, PCs, and smartphones, "are not all that great," which could be contributing to the sector-wide pressure, in addition to the disappointing earnings from major players. Rasgon shifts the focus to the question of "the pace of the recovery," noting that the stocks have held up "remarkably" despite the revisions, suggesting this is "a delayed reaction."

Recent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East haven't been the sole detractor from 2024's market momentum. One of the leaders in the S&P is chip-making powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) which is down 15% over the past month. Is the rally for Big Tech players over or just on a pause? F/m Investments President and Chief Investment Officer Alex Morris joins Market Domination to discuss the chip sector and Nvidia's recent dip in share price. Morris weighs in on the current market landscape and how Nvidia has performed recently: "It's surprising to see it today. There's no great catalyst for it. Nvidia didn't come out and say 'we're out of the game, AI is over.' But we have to remember Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Big Tech names, they're momentum names and momentum names occasionally need to take a breather... The geopolitical events aren't the catalyst but they are a good opportunity for folks to reevaluate where their money is and sometimes you take your profits."

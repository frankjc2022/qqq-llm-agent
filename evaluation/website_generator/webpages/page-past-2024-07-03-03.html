In June, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) split its stock on a 10-for-1 basis and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) executed a 50-for-1 split, the first in the restaurant chain’s history. Even Walmart (NYSE:WMT) split its stock on a 3-for-1 basis earlier this year.

Shares that currently trade for more than $1,600 each will each be worth about $160 a stub. A stock split changes nothing about a company. An investor could either buy Broadcom stock before or after the division and he would still own the same company. Yet splits are often viewed by the stock market favorably. They signal management believes additional growth and profits are coming.

Market Domination welcomes Barron's associate editor Al Root to discuss Boeing's (BA) latest legal obstacle as it faces potential charges from Department of Justice (DOJ) officials. Sanders Morris Harris chairman George Ball later joins the show to elaborate why he believes the US economy isn't a textbook case of being in a Goldilocks environment, but is actually reflective of a "Winnie the Pooh" environment. The top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform this hour include Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO); Archer Aviation (ACHR); Paramount Global (PARA); and Nikola (NKLA).

Rosenblatt Securities senior research analyst Hans Mosesmann joins Market Domination to explain why he is not worried about the stock's bumpy previous weeks. Mosesmann has issued the highest price target for Nvidia on Wall Street. Mosesmann has a long-term view, explaining that the sale pressure is negligible when one considers that Nvidia is going to be the "best way to play AI for the next 10 years." He adds that Nvidia is not just a semiconductor company anymore but a platform that is "all things AI."

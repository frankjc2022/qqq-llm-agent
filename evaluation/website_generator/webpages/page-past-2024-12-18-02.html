Core Scientific (CORZ) CEO and president Adam Sullivan joins Madison Mills on Catalysts to talk about how the company is balancing its resources to facilitate crypto mining and AI data centers. "We were the largest bitcoin mining company for the past three years, and that's really driven by the fact that we had to bring in traditional data center people to actually run the business. That's really been our differentiator," Sullivan tells Yahoo Finance. The CEO says, "We think of ourselves as a digital infrastructure company, whether it's building data centers for bitcoin mining or whether it's building data centers to host hundreds of megawatts of [Nvidia's (NVDA)] GB200 that you guys were talking about earlier, you know, our core competency is driven through large-scale digital infrastructure." Looking to 2025, the company expects "a relatively equal split" between crypto mining and AI. Sullivan adds, "Our expectation is to continue to grow the data center part of the business, which is just a radical shift from the high volatility bitcoin mining space moving into the data center space" as the "long-term contracts" provide "a lot of long-term and free cash-flow stability that investors really enjoy."

"This is not the end of the world for Nvidia," Woods emphasizes. While the stock is currently under scrutiny as the only Magnificent Seven stock declining since November 1, Woods maintains that Nvidia remains fundamentally strong. He says overall, the stock is still in an uptrend. However, he sees a "near-term head and shoulders top" formation, which he views as a potential buying opportunity for investors. "The fundamental story hasn't changed, nothing has changed there," Woods tells Madison Mills. "To me, this is just a pause." Addressing the Dow Jones Industrial Average's movement, Woods notes the index is down 3.78% in its nine day losing streak, with UnitedHealth (UNH) leading the decline by erasing 725 points. "The move is just a garden variety sell-off, but the amount of stocks that are down is a little head-scratching," he states. Woods points out one positive: technology, communications, and discretionary sectors continue to lead gains — the same sectors that initially propelled the current bull market.

While the narrow leadership has raised some concerns about concentration and broadening trading themes, Baird Investment strategist Ross Mayfield tells Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Morning Brief that these worries may be overblown. "It's certainly something we keep an eye on, but I would say that if you had been worried about that concentration or used it as a reason to get out of the market at any point over the last couple of years, it would have been a mistake," Mayfield says. The strategist believes investors "should be celebrating that some of the biggest and most innovative companies are in our markets. Concentration risk, or heavy concentration, has not been a good forward indicator over the last 40 or 50 years based on the data that we've seen." "It's something to keep an eye on [as] it maybe makes the market a little bit more fragile to something like Nvidia having a bad stretch run, but it's not something that we worry about too much," Mayfield adds.

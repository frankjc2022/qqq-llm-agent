Seana Smith and Brad Smith help investors through the market open and discuss what's moving markets, like June's retail sales data. In this installment of The Morning Brief, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) reported second quarter earnings. Argus Research director of financial services research Stephen Biggar joins the show to discuss the latest Big Bank earnings and what lower interest rates would hold in store for the banking sector. As Apple (AAPL) hopes to inspire a new upgrade cycle in its newest iPhone's AI features — dubbed Apple Intelligence — the tech giant also has its eyes set on the consumer market in India. D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria describes the country's consumer prospects as a "long-term promise" for Apple. Other trending stock tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform include Match Group (MTCH), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Shopify (SHOP).

Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss some of the biggest trends dominating the tech sector as second quarter earnings season kicks off. Luria points to Microsoft's (MSFT) AI efforts driving a PC upgrade cycle. He explains, "the impact is so broad right now in the implementation of more AI and generative AI, including in the PC category... AI PCs have been for sale. They'll probably be part of a cycle as well. It may not be as pronounced as the iPhone cycle, but considering PC sales have been in a hangover the last couple of years, they've started showing signs of growth." He believes that the outperformance of tech stocks boils down to the fact that tech companies have "grown earnings when others have not." He also attributes the growth to diversification, explaining, "they present less risk because their businesses are so entrenched and diversified." He highlights Amazon (AMZN) as an example, and expects it to be well-positioned ahead of its earnings. He argues, "AWS is the biggest hyperscaler, and it's done a lot to catch up to Azure in terms of AI capabilities. And yet Amazon is getting very little credit in terms of multiple. It's trading at at average multiple compared to its historical rates. And so we think that's where when they get more credit that stock will outperform."

D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss the tech giant's growth and what it means for its upcoming iPhone release cycle. AI integration will be a key component in the newest iPhones as Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI at its Worldwide Developers Conference. "We haven't had a major iPhone upgrade cycle since iPhone 12. And now that there is a sense that there's enough new functionality and uses for the phone that we will have an upgrade cycle, which could last for a year or two. That warrants this excitement around the stock," Luria says. He believes that new Apple Intelligence features will compel consumers enough to drive a new device upgrade cycle. As Apple looks to diversify its exposure to global consumer markets, Luria believes India "has a long-term promise," explaining: "It's the country that's creating the most middle-class and upper-middle-class population anywhere around the world by far. It is in that sense the kind of driver that China was for the last 20 or 30 years. And so that's why it's a critically important market." He adds that there are no domestic competitors to Apple in India — like Huawei in China — allowing the tech giant to dominate the market.

Chamber of Progress CEO and founder Adam Kovacevic joins Brad Smith and Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime to discuss his tech industry outlook. "One of the, I think, good pieces of news is that President-elect Trump has appointed a number of people from the tech world, venture capitalists, people with tech experience to prominent positions," Kovacevic says, noting that this is a "good sign" for the industry. He adds that Trump's second term will likely lead to a shift in the US government's attitude toward AI. The Biden administration's "main approach to artificial intelligence was to say, 'This is an area where we ought to tread carefully, put up guardrails, and focus on safety,'" Kovacevic says. "What I think you are going to see with Trump is a pivot from safety to really [seeing] AI as an economic asset for the United States, a national asset for the United States, where we should go out and beat other countries, particularly China in AI." Watch the video above to hear more about the expected tech landscape in 2025, including the possible TikTok ban, Big Tech execs courting Trump, Musk's role in the US government, and more.

JLL Americas President of Retail Naveen Jaggi joins Catalysts to analyze what this statistic reveals about consumer behavior and the broader retail sector. Jaggi emphasizes the remarkable resilience of US consumer spending. "I think it really says a lot about the fact that, at the end of the day, this consumer economy keeps finding ways to engage with the consumer," he observes. However, Jaggi points out a shift in shopping patterns: "We have become a value-oriented consumer society." Retailers like Ross (ROST), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT) are experiencing consistent foot traffic as shoppers seek bargains. This value-hunting extends online, with Jaggi noting that "the US consumer continues to find ways to find the best bang for the dollar." Looking ahead to 2025, Jaggi expresses optimism about the department store sector. He views Nordstrom's (JWN) announcement to go private as "great news," describing the retailer as "the gold standard" and suggesting the move will enable better focus on long-term growth strategies. "Retail requires a long-term mindset," he tells Yahoo Finance. "It does not require a quarter-to-quarter mindset only."

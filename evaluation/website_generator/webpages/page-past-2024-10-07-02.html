Goldman Sachs Director of Americas Equity Research Steve Kron joins Catalysts to discuss the details. Kron explains that the purpose of this list is to help investors identify stocks where Goldman Sachs has "the highest level of conviction" for outperformance. Since the list's introduction last June, Kron emphasizes that "the feedback has been fantastic." Pinterest (PINS) was recently added to the list, while Amazon (AMZN) and Guidewire (GWRE) were removed. According to Kron, Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan believes Pinterest has the ability to "monetize their user base," with margin expansion potential over the next five years and earnings projected to be 6% above estimates in 2025. The stock also presents a favorable 3-to-1 upside-to-downside risk ratio. As for Amazon and Guidewire, they were removed to "keep the list fresh," though Kron notes they remain solid stock picks. Regarding the selection process, Kron tells Yahoo Finance, "We spend a lot of time on investment process, and we spend a lot of time with our analysts talking about stock recommendations. So these are sourced from them," with names like Nvidia (NVDA) and Citigroup (C) both making the list. Watch the video above to hear Kron's explanation on how the firm determines the themes of the list.

The major stock market indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) closed in positive territory on Thursday after being hit by a three-day sell-off at the beginning of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped over 680 points while the S&P 500 had its best trading day since January 2023. Raymond James CIO Larry Adam joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the market action and how investors can navigate the pullback. "What happened over last Friday and then Monday, I think everybody got a little bit premature thinking that this economy was going to roll over into a recession, that the Fed was going to have these emergency cuts, and the reality is that the economy is slowing, but it's not collapsing," Adam says of the sell-off. He believes that while the economy will continue to slow, there will not be a recession when the Federal Reserves begins cutting rates. "I think we've learned over time that the market loves these narratives and you get to see these more extreme moves," he adds, thus fundamentals and earnings are more reliable metrics moving forward. As the tech sector (XLK) took a beating this week, Adam believes that Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings will provide key insight into the sustainability of the AI race. "Our base case is that the AI theme is still very early stages and that it will continue to drive the tech sector for the foreseeable future," he explains. He notes that in Wednesday's trading session, mega-cap tech stocks went into oversold conditions, so investors could use dips as good buying opportunities.

While hit in the recent sell-off, opportunity opens up to buy back in, but which stocks deserve investor attention? Summit Global Investments CIO Dave Harden joins Market Domination for Good Buy or Goodbye? to give insight into which of the Mag 7 should be picked up after the recent sell-off. Harden chooses Microsoft (MSFT) as his good buy citing its recent strong earnings performance, which outperformed many analyst expectations. In it addition, he cites the company's ability to monetize its AI developments, products, and services, as well its enterprise and cloud strength. Harden chooses Tesla (TSLA) as his goodbye citing its current struggle with its core business of EV sales. He also says it has a rather lengthy timeline for its AI products and services, as well as CEO Elon Musk's erratic behavior, which he thinks doesn't instill confidence from investors.

Nvidia (NVDA) maintains its leadership position by exceeding third quarter estimates earlier this week while Amazon (AMZN) deepened its AI commitment with an additional $4 billion investment in Anthropic, designating the startup as Amazon Web Services' primary service provider. "We really are at the building stage of AI," Epistrophy Capital Research chief market strategist Cory Johnson tells Morning Brief, calling it "a real life-changing thing." Johnson notes that the Amazon-Anthropic partnership is "interesting... from a semiconductor perspective." He explains that with Anthropic agreeing to help develop Amazon's "Trainium" chips, Amazon has effectively "bought themselves a customer" for when the chips are completed. However, Johnson raises concerns about Nvidia's market position: "I'm really curious about what the partners of Nvidia are going to say to Nvidia three years from now. 'Hey, remember when you took your gross margins from 46% to 79%, and you made us pay all that when we couldn't go anywhere else?' I mean [I] wonder if that's going to create bad feelings among customers."

Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations. Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry. Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options. Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: "It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software — and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in."

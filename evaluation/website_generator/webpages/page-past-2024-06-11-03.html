The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed at another set of record highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by 120 points as stocks prepare for Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.

Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan explains, "They generate about 38% of their revenues right now from cloud. And Oracle's got a great opportunity."

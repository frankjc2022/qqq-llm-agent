CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss Google's AI moves and the future of the tech company. Google introduced new AI-powered search capabilities and Gemini capabilities. The company also announced it'll start featuring AI overviews for searches in the US by the end of the week, with rollout plans for the rest of the world set for the coming months. "They've clearly been in beta mode here over the last couple of months. They're now going full gear into it, and I think that's a good thing," Zino says. "What they're doing on the infrastructure side of things, what they announced at Google Next last month, kind of shows really they are best in class on that side of things," Zino says of Google's momentum. He adds, "Alphabet continues to be that ultimate consumer company out there, and they are essentially the internet in many respects."

Analysts have expressed concerns about Tesla's future, citing a "mini-crisis" for the company, with CEO Elon Musk appearing detached from the situation. The company delivered only 387,000 units, missing Wall Street estimates. Analysts predict that Tesla's growth in key markets like China will be difficult due to increased competition and demand issues. Musk has also been criticized for losing AI talent to his other ventures, such as xAI, which could hinder Tesla's ambitions to be seen as more than just a car manufacturer.

Analysts are weighing in on the potential outcomes of such a deal, indicating that it could significantly impact the market.

This reflects the broader trend of increasing competition in the AI sector, with Alphabet's investments in AI being described as potentially "revolutionary." Analysts believe that Alphabet's strategic mergers and acquisitions could position the company as a leader in the forthcoming AI revolution.

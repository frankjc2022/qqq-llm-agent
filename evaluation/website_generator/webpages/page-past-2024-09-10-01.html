The platform was announced in the wake of a torrent of generative AI news from companies like Google and Open AI, causing concern that the famously tight-lipped tech giant had missed the boat on the latest tech craze.

Apple (AAPL) demonstrated that it "can continue to innovate" at Monday's event, Flax said, noting that "the user experience is continuing to change" while "the developer community remains healthy." The analyst said he expects "better growth over the next year, which will contribute to stock price outperformance." Flax said that Nvidia (NVDA) stands to gain as cloud vendors like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) invest in artificial intelligence (AI) despite near-term volatility amid Blackwell delays. He says the key for Nvidia "is to continue to execute on its product cycles." After Oracle (ORCL) stock jumped following its first quarter earnings beat, Flax noted positive feedback from Oracle's cloud customers. The analyst expects "growth for Oracle cloud to remain robust over the next few years" though "it's certainly lumpy quarter to quarter."

While this shows that many tech firms are on the right path, only seven have set specific reduction targets that are essential to keeping business flight numbers in check, T&E said.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Apple, Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney: What's next for the stocks?</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-09-10 21:50:56+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi and Catalysts Host Madison Mills sit down with Goldman Sachs senior equity research analyst Michael Ng at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech Conference to discuss the state of media and tech companies, from Apple (AAPL) to Disney (DIS). On Monday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its newest product offerings at its highly anticipated "It's Glowtime" event in Cupertino, California. Ng explains that the event "delivered in line with investor expectations," noting that historically, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 by 70 basis points on announcement days, and following the event, it underperformed by about 100 basis points. "We think that was in line with historical events. And when you look at the individual product announcements, it came in mostly as expected," he adds. Ng reiterates his Buy rating on Apple, arguing that "there's an underappreciated uplift in their normalized earnings power as more people start to upgrade their iPhones." He continues, "We think that investors have historically thought about Apple iPhones at a normalized sell-through rate at about 225 to 230 million units. And we think that AI and some of the new product features that are going to get rolled out over the next few years is going to bring that normalized run rate closer to 250 to 260 million." While there is debate among investors as to whether AI will be the demand driver for Apple, Ng is bullish on the technology. He also highlights that hardware changes will also drive an upgrade cycle as screen sizes increase, devices become thinner, and rumors that the iPhone 18 may potentially be foldable. Turning to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Ng believes that the company is managing its video business holistically. "The linear TV network business is certainly having challenges. Cord cutting is unrelenting, and paid TV subscriber declines will continue to occur. That being said, it's an incredibly cash-generative business and it helps to fund growth investments elsewhere in the Warner Brothers portfolio," he explains. He points to momentum in its streaming platform Max, and argues that "there's a crown jewel in the Warner Brothers film and television studio." Meanwhile, Ng believes that one of Disney's (DIS) biggest challenges will be its succession planning. Investors have praised the company's growth under CEO Bob Iger, and Ng notes that before Iger's return to the company, Disney faced "a few missteps," especially in its film and TV divisions. "I think there's a tremendous amount of focus on what that succession planning looks like. One observation that I'll make is that they have an incredibly deep bench of talented executives across each of their business lines, theme parks, film and TV studios, and obviously at ESPN," Ng tells Yahoo Finance.

Bank of America senior IT hardware analyst Wamsi Mohan joined Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss how the new Huawei phone could affect competition in the China region. Huawei "is a formidable competitor" to Apple amid increased competition in the China market, Mohan tells Yahoo Finance. Mohan argues the combination of Apple Intelligence and competition from the new Huawei device is "relatively net neutral" for Apple in the country, highlighting that the iPhone maker said support for Apple Intelligence in the Chinese language is coming in 2025. "Apple will continue to take share in China in the long run," Mohan said. Apple is "giving up some cyclical share" in the near term, he noted, adding that Bank of America analysts are "very optimistic about the China potential" in the long term as the middle class grows in the region. "All of that is going to add incremental users into the Apple ecosystem." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Davidson has initiated coverage on Meta Platforms (META) — with a Buy rating and $600 per share price target — and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) — with a Neutral rating and $170 per share price target. Additionally, D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria has excluded Tesla (TSLA) in his Magnificent Seven coverage in the firm's "compute sector," grouping Meta and Alphabet with Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA). On Tesla, Luria wrote “if it looks like a duck (greater than 90% of revenue from cars) and quacks like a duck (greater than 90% of profits from cars) it might just be a duck (a car company)" in a note on Tuesday. Luria sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to talk more about his call about these tech giants and their investments in AI and computing. "Those markets require scale, reach, and capital. So unlike previous waves of technology innovation that came from startups, innovation now is coming from... these biggest companies. So these six companies will continue to dominate in AI and spatial computing, and extend their lead from the sectors they're already in — desktop and mobile computing, cloud computing and advertising, computing," Luria tells Yahoo Finance. "They'll keep dominating those and they'll dominate the next two waves." Luria elaborates on how Meta is differentiating its AI usage and large language models from its Silicon Valley counterparts as prominent tech players continue to spend more on Nvidia chips.

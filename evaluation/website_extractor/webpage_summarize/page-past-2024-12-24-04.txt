On December 24, 2024, U.S. equity markets experienced a positive trading session, buoyed by strong performance in the tech sector, particularly driven by Tesla (TSLA). The S&P 500 rose by 1%, marking its third consecutive day of gains following a volatile Federal Reserve meeting. Consumer discretionary stocks emerged as the top-performing sector of the year.

Tesla's stock surged due to a significant announcement from Hyundai, which indicated a shift in charging technology for electric vehicles to Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). This development could potentially bring over 112,000 new customers to Tesla's Supercharger network. The company's stock was a standout performer on Christmas Eve, contributing to the overall rise of major tech stocks, often referred to as the "Magnificent Seven."

Despite the positive market sentiment, analysts expressed concerns about Tesla's sales performance in Europe and potential political challenges in North America, leading to recommendations for a sell on TSLA stock. Analysts also highlighted Tesla's position in the broader context of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, suggesting that it remains a key player in the evolving tech landscape.

Looking ahead, the tech industry is preparing for changes with the anticipated return of President-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to shift the government's approach to AI from a cautious stance to viewing it as a national economic asset. This pivot could influence the competitive landscape, particularly against countries like China.

Overall, the market's performance on Christmas Eve reflects a blend of optimism in the tech sector, particularly for Tesla, alongside caution regarding future challenges and the evolving regulatory environment for AI technologies.

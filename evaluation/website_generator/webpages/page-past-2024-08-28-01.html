Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and Scharf Investments managing director Eric Lynch joins Market Domination to discuss the move and what the firm may do with the cash. Lynch explains that consumers and investors shouldn't be concerned about the move. Rather, he sees it as a testament to Buffett's commitment to having a margin of safety: "Look, it's a great company, but he bought it in 2016 at 10 times earnings. He's cut it over half when it's been trading above 30 times earnings. It hasn't moved its sales and its operating income level on the aggregate in almost three years, so he's worried about the margin of safety there." He adds that with this new cash flow, Buffett is "finding places to play," but ultimately is "waiting for better valuation." Lynch notes that Berkshire recently bought Chubb (CB), an insurance company, explaining that insurance premiums are increasing about 10% yearly. In addition, Buffett has identified several lucrative opportunities in Japan. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

On September 9, the tech giant will unveil its latest iPhone generation alongside the latest Apple Watches and AirPods. Should tech consumers run to the Apple Store upon release or wait to go out and spend on a new device? CNET editor-at-large Bridget Carey joins Wealth! to talk about the best consumer tech deals ahead of the Labor Day Weekend and as retailers shift focus farther down the road to the holiday season. While you may want to upgrade some of your tech, Carey advises consumers to be cautious about Apple (AAPL): "There's going to be an Apple event soon, just two weeks. Apple is going to be revealing new gadgets, and so I would say if you're going for like a brand new phone, no. But it's a great time for a sale if you don't care about having the newest stuff because retailers have to sell their inventory, so they're going to discount all the current earbuds and the other gear like old phones."

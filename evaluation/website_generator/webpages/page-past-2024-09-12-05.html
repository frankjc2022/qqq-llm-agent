    <div class='news-section'><h2>News on stock symbol GOOGL</h2><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>This factor will set apart competing gen AI tools: Analyst</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-09-12 22:09:05+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Nvidia's (NVDA) latest earnings highlighted a major issue for the AI trade; despite beating earnings expectations, investors were disappointed as they looked for significant returns on massive capital expenditures (CapEx). RBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst Brad Erickson joins Asking for a Trend to break down the state of the AI trade and the technology's outlook amid a heated competition. Erickson explains that generative AI platforms are emerging "right in front of us," pointing to software engineering efficiencies, customer support platforms, and marketing tools as examples. He also highlights sovereign AI, where countries are spending on the technology to use and access data that no one else has. He adds, "If you look at like the top four or five CapEx spenders on AI infrastructure, it's $200 billion and it's going up next year probably by more than 10%." He explains that investors are in a position where they have to put "blind faith" into AI players, knowing that it will pay off in the future. He tells Yahoo Finance, "From my perspective, like we're taking a little bit more of a measured approach, saying, 'Look, $200 billion. Think about what you need to do to maintain operating margins.' Pretty simple math of, like, are we really talking about $300, $400 billion of marginal revenue every single year? Those are big numbers." Erickson believes that competing AI tools from names like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and OpenAI will ultimately "end up looking a lot of the same kind of thing." He argues that distribution is a more important factor and will likely determine the level of success.

Google's removal of the feature that publishers used to reduce their dependence on Google is a key piece of the case in which the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of states are seeking to show the company unfairly dominated markets for the technology that facilitates online advertising.  The Justice Department showed emails and documents where Google employees discussed the company losing revenue because publishers were using their ability to set a higher minimum for bids from Google's AdX than for other exchanges.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Is Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) the Best AI Stock to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner David Tepper?</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-09-12 19:00:13+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper.

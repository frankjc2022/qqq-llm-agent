EV sales globally are expected to rise to 16.6 million vehicles this year, from 13.7 million in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency, with China's growth outpacing other regions.  Analysts caution, however, that Tuesday's sales figures are insufficient to forecast a reacceleration of EV sales growth.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>EV Stocks Surge: Are They Back?</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-02 23:13:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Recently, the EV theme has regained some life, with stocks such as Tesla and Rivian Automotive enjoying strong price action following solid delivery numbers.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Chinese firms eye Morocco as way to cash in on US electric vehicle subsidies</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-02 22:30:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

Catalysts Host Madison Mills covers the top market and economic stories this hour, which includes Yahoo Finance reporting on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's latest inflation comments from the European Central Bank (ECB) Forum on Central Banking in Portugal. The labor market is in focus ahead of the June jobs report scheduled to be released Friday morning, July 5. Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti comes onto the show to talk about the European Union's (EU) latest regulatory battles against Big Tech titans Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) under its Digital Markets Act (DMA). TD Bank Global Head of FX and EM Strategy Mark McCormick joins Catalysts in-studio to discuss the influence the Fed's interest rate journey and the 2024 US presidential election could have on the US dollar. This post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Meta to end ban on the word 'shaheed' on oversight board's recommendations</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-02 17:19:12+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>The company has been criticized for years over its handling of content involving the Middle East, including in a 2021 study Meta itself commissioned that found its approach had an "adverse human rights impact" on Palestinians and other Arabic-speaking users of its services.  The oversight board, which is funded by Meta but operates independently, started its review last year because the word accounted for more content removals on the company's platforms than any other single word or phrase.  Meta is the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Big Tech-EU regulation battle is 'new chapter in an old movie'</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-02 16:05:39+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Meta Platforms (META) is under fire by EU regulators who claim the company's ad subscription model is a pay-for-content scheme that requires users to choose between paying a fee or handing over more personal data to use for targeted advertising. Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as "gatekeepers." Meta was identified by the Commission as a "gatekeeper" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, "I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model." He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a "slap on the wrist" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): "Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not. To me, it's more important, not that the fines are imposed, but the behavior of firms changes up-front because you don't want to fine people after they drive too fast. You want people to start slowing down." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

American Giant founder and CEO Bayard Winthrop joins the program to talk about the apparel brand's partnership with Walmart (WMT) as it seeks to cut clothing prices for consumers amid expensive fast fashion trends.

Tyler Ellegard, Gradient Investments portfolio manager, joins Market Domination to discuss hit outlook for the second half of the year. Ellegard expresses cautious optimism, suggesting that "good times could continue," but warns that the second half of the year will likely be "choppy." He advises investors to adopt a more diversified portfolio approach, cautioning against overreliance on large stocks such as Nvidia. Ellegard highlights energy, healthcare, and industrials as promising sectors for investment. However, he clarifies that this doesn't mean completely abandoning tech giants: "That doesn't say that we're taking everything off the table from these mega-caps. We still like the Googles, we still like Meta (META), and we still like Amazon (AMZN). We still think there's room to run. But we may just be a little underweight on the Nvidias (NVDA), Microsofts (MSFT), and Apples (AAPL) right now".

This week in AI, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down "Chevron deference," a 40-year-old ruling on federal agencies' power that required courts to defer to agencies' interpretations of congressional laws.

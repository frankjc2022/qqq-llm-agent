The tech sector's "earnings numbers are coming through," Draho said, highlighting Nvidia's most recent quarterly report, in which he said "the results were still impressive" despite the market's reaction. "Perhaps didn't guide upwards as much as the market has liked in the past," he said, adding "the bar is just so high" for the chipmaker that "there's easy scope for disappointment." Draho said Nvidia's market position is promising, given that demand for its products outpaces supply as UBS expects artificial intelligence (AI) spending to accelerate in the next year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang spoke at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference, saying there is "intense" demand for the company's chips. "It's not bad owning these kind of companies that have really strong earnings power, really dominant positions" rather than "taking either a lot of cyclical risk or getting too defensive in an environment where ultimately we still think it's going to be a soft landing and a relatively good macro environment over the next six to 12 months," Draho tells Yahoo Finance.

Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) led the charge for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, climbing more than 8% intraday after comments made by CEO Jensen Huang at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference highlighted continued AI demand. B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the most recent market movement. Hogan explains that this day and week have been "interesting" for markets. He explains, "[This is] the first time that I can remember we've seen an S&P 500 lose and gain 100 points in a single week." He notes that volatility is typical for September, and believes that markets "overreacted" to CPI data. However, as September is also conference season, comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang got investors "excited about AI again," taking markets back up. "I think that when you take a step back and say, if our biggest concern is that today's modestly hotter core CPI number means the Fed's [Federal Reserve] going to go 25 basis points versus 50, that was consensus coming into the day, right? So it just went from 70% to 85% consensus. So I think it's just a major overreaction in what has become an oversold September tape. And I think that the rally in the afternoon probably makes a whole lot more sense," Hogan adds. He notes that semiconductors were down about 23% going into Wednesday's trading day, and argues "it doesn't take much of a push to get investors back and excited about a group that was trading significantly higher than this just two months ago."

With options, traders can employ different strategies and tactics.  One such strategy is the butterfly spread. BayCrest Managing Director, Equity Derivatives David Boole says the butterfly strategy is "used more when there's a lot more volatility in the market." He adds that traders like them because "for a small amount of premium, you get exposure to a wide range." Watch the video above to hear Boole explain butterfly trades that were made based on the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and Nvidia (NVDA).

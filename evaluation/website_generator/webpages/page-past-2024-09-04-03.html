Here are some other stocks to consider</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-09-04 17:30:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Nvidia (NVDA) lost over $278 billion in its market cap from the latest sell-off on Wall Street as the company gets hit with concerns from the US Department of Justice and more. Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO & Chief Analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Morning Brief to discuss Nvidia's recent performance and what challenges are ahead for the company. Moorhead feels that headwinds for the stock price right now are more macro-economically driven, "but when you look at the growth, the 100, 200% growth, this is all about delivering Blackwell on time. Like Jensen said on the call, doing that with the highest level of compatibility with the best yields that has a positive impact on on costs and hence margins." Looking ahead at which stock may be a great alternative to Nvidia, Moorhead claims: "AMD (AMD) is the next best replacement, particularly because they both have GPUs followed very closely by Broadcom (AVGO), the counter to a GPU is what's called an ASIC and those are primarily, built by Broadcom."  Read more about Nvidia's plunge here.

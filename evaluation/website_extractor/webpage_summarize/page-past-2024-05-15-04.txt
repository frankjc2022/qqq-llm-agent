A judge has rejected Tesla's attempt to dismiss a lawsuit alleging that the company misled customers about the self-driving capabilities of its vehicles. The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, claims that since 2016, Tesla and Elon Musk have falsely advertised their Autopilot and self-driving technologies, leading consumers to pay a premium for their cars under the impression that these features were imminent.

In related news, financial analyst Kevin Paffrath expressed concerns about Tesla's financial health, highlighting a "massive cash problem" and suggesting that investors should exercise patience regarding the company's future. He noted that upcoming events, such as the shareholder vote and the anticipated robotaxi event, could significantly impact Tesla's stock performance.

Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Nio announced plans to launch one new car model annually under its Onvo brand, with a focus on affordability. The Onvo L60, aimed at competing with Tesla's Model Y, is set to launch in September, coinciding with Tesla's new model deliveries.

Tesla is also facing challenges, including a recent decision to cut 601 jobs in the Bay Area amid declining sales and stock prices, particularly concerning the Cybertruck. Following a brief recovery in stock value, Tesla shares fell again, influenced by reports of internal team changes and ongoing market pressures.

Overall, the electric vehicle market remains competitive, with Nio's new offerings and Tesla's financial struggles highlighting the challenges both companies face in maintaining market share and investor confidence.

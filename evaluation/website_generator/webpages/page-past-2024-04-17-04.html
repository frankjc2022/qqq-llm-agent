Musk’s massive 2018 options grant, valued at more than $55 billion when awarded, was voided by a Delaware judge in January, who cited inadequate disclosures made to shareholders.  “Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value.”</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Tesla (TSLA) Sees a More Significant Dip Than Broader Market: Some Facts to Know</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-04-17 21:45:21+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>In the closing of the recent trading day, Tesla (TSLA) stood at $155.45, denoting a -1.06% change from the preceding trading day.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Tesla Tries to Revive Elon Musk’s Big Payday After Court Rejected It</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-04-17 21:32:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>The fight over  Elon Musk’s  pay is back on.  Tesla  board asked shareholders to again vote in favor of its CEO’s multibillion-dollar pay package.  The board and shareholders approved the pay proposal in 2018, but a Delaware court in January struck it down because it said the approval process was “deeply flawed.”</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Tesla is a 'great company,' but 'mismanaged': Investor</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-04-17 21:18:41+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Shares of Tesla (TSLA) continue to slide as the company once again asked shareholders to approve CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package that was originally struck down by a Delaware judge. The judge involved in the case called the pay package excessive and said the company's board failed to justify it. The compensation includes no salary or cash bonus but instead stock options that are issued based on performance threshold. Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the situation with Tesla and Musk and why he is "grateful" to have sold the stock in recent months. Gerber gives his full thoughts over the company and the position he has taken: "We trimmed Tesla down to a reasonable position, about a 2% position in our firm and in my fund. I love the company. I want to make it clear, the products are amazing. It's a great company with great employees and I just think it's being mismanaged at this point. And it -- you know, I think their strategies are not working. So we've lowered our position, I hope I don't end up selling out of this position because I do think the long-term for Tesla could be amazing if it had the focus of a full-time CEO."

To provide insight into these developments, Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware Charles Elson Founding Director joins Market Domination. Elson expresses skepticism about the potential approval of Musk's compensation plan, noting that even if shareholders were to vote in favor, it may not supersede the previous court decision that struck down the package. He emphasizes that the plan being proposed is not meaningfully different from the one that was deemed "not effectively fair" by the courts. On the proposed move, "The real question is, why would a shareholder vote for a move that the CEO says a court has decided against me because what I did was inequitable? So, I'm going to a jurisdiction where they'll say that's okay," Elson told Yahoo Finance. Elson argues that, ultimately, the board's responsibility is to ensure that Tesla survives beyond Musk's tenure. "At some point you have to say 'enough.' That's that where I think you need board refreshment. Obviously this board is unwilling to do it," Elson says.

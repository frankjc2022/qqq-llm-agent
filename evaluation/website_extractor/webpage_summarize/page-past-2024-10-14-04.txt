The company is rolling out new AI tools and products, including augmented reality glasses, which are expected to enhance its market presence.

**Nvidia** and other AI chipmakers are experiencing a surge in stock prices, driven by bullish sentiment surrounding artificial intelligence investments. The overall market is witnessing increased volatility, with several stocks, including Netflix and GE Aerospace, also drawing positive attention from analysts.

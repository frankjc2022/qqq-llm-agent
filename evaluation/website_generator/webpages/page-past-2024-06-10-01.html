CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino and Neuberger Berman managing director Dan Flax join Market Domination to discuss if Nvidia can maintain its lead over Apple (AAPL). Zino believes Nvidia will continue to be "the main driver in AI monetization" for the next few years. He also foresees a "broadening in the customer market" within the cloud, saying he "remains very excited" about the company, noting it will outperform Apple within the next year. Flax shared a similar sentiment, stating, "We can continue to own both names," but adding, "for new money, I would have a little bit of a preference for Nvidia here, given the stronger growth over the next twelve to twenty-four months."

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed at record highs while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell into the red. This comes off the back of the Federal Reserve leaving interest rates unchanged as inflation cools. BNP Paribas Managing Director and Senior Multi-Asset Specialist Mark Howard explains that while the Fed's decision was noteworthy, May's Consumer Price Index (CPI) "was the real mover" of markets. The report triggered a rally in tech stocks and relieved Treasury yields. Oracle (ORCL) stock closed at an all-time high, boosted by its partnership announcement with Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and OpenAI. Broadcom (AVGO) is also on the rise after reporting second quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and a quarterly dividend of $5.25 per share. As Tesla (TSLA) shareholders are currently voting on CEO Elon Musk's pay package valued at $46 billion, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPers) — which holds 9.2 million Tesla shares — disclosed it will vote against Musk's compensation package. Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan explains what Tesla shareholders have to gain from approving the pay package and the reasons why shareholders would vote it down. Yahoo Finance shared a poll at the start of the trading week, asking whether Tesla shareholders should approve Musk's pay package. Well over 400,000 respondents have participated in the poll, 96% of which voted "No." This post was written by Melanie Riehl</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Tesla board went about Musk pay package wrong way: Investor</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-06-12 21:49:31+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Tesla (TSLA) shareholders are now voting on whether to approve CEO Elon Musk's pay package, now valued at $46 billion based on the company's current stock price. The results will be revealed on Thursday, June 13 at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting. Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management CEO Ross Gerber — a Tesla investor who owns about 300,000 shares — shares his reasons for voting against Musk's compensation package. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPers), which holds 9.2 million Tesla shares, has also disclosed it will vote against the pay package. A major incentive for passing the package through is that shareholders believe it will encourage Musk to stay on as CEO. Gerber states: "I think he already has stepped back from the company and that's been going on for two years now. And then he just eliminated every meaningful executive at Tesla over the last six months. So he put Tesla in a position where if we don't vote for him and he, let's say, threatens to leave the company and leaves the company, there's actually nobody at Tesla to run it." Gerber's biggest grievances are aimed at Tesla's board of directors, finding them to be "negligent" for not negotiating the size of Musk's pay package, which serves to detract from Tesla's main objective: manufacturing and selling EVs. Yahoo Finance shared a poll at the start of the trading week, asking whether Tesla shareholders should approve Musk's pay package. Well over 400,000 respondents have participated in the poll, 96% of which voted "No." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

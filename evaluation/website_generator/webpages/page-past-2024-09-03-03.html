Bernstein senior analyst Stacy Rasgon joins Catalysts to break down his call on Broadcom and what investors will be looking for in the company's earnings report. Rasgon has an Outperform rating on Broadcom, arguing that the company has "the second-best AI story in the space." He highlights how Broadcom designs chips for hyperscalers like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META), and believes that its AI guidance this year has been "reasonably conservative." However, Broadcom's core business has struggled this year, which Rasgon attributes to a cyclical low hitting the chip industry. He points to Broadcom's software business, VMWare, as a catalyst for the company within the next year. "I think there's good upside on the software. Even if you just look more broadly, I would say it's got some of the best operating metrics, margins, and free cash, and everything else in the space by a mile. And it's still very inexpensive. It's at a pretty sharp discount to the broader semiconductor space. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Bernstein senior analyst Stacy Rasgon joins Catalysts to discuss the print and what it signals about the health of the overall sector. Rasgon notes that monthly data "tends to be a little noisy." Instead, investors should pay close attention to the three-month outlook, which is more supportive of the chip industry's growth. "More broadly in the industry, you have to remember, like currently it's been a very asynchronous cycle. Some end markets have been very bad, some of them have hit bottom, some of them are past bottoms, some of them are not," he says. "I'd say things like PCs and smartphones, they're not great this year, but they'll probably grow a little bit versus versus last year. AI is clearly off the charts strong." He explains that because of this asynchronous cycle, it's hard to look at the entire sector as a whole and make a conclusion: "You do have to pick and choose which parts of the market you're looking at, which parts of the market you want to be playing in."

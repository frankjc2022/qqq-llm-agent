William Blair Group head of the energy and sustainability research sector Jed Dorsheimer joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to examine clean energy developer Tesla Energy and its role in the space. “The energy problem is much bigger than I think most people understand,” Dorsheimer tells Yahoo Finance, explaining that Tesla Energy’s Megapack, a large-scale stationary battery, not only helps store energy but can also help stabilize the power grid to prevent outages. “The grid stability globally is actually getting more and more fragile. And so there's going to be more deployments, particularly as we wind down thermal in terms of coal." “This is an opportunity for Megapack,” Dorsheimer says, adding, “We see an opportunity for this business to really scale and to add a level of profitability that most... clients don't have in their models.

What are tech investors making of it?</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-10-24 17:00:48+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Tesla (TSLA) was the first member of the Magnificent Seven to report earnings this season, posting mixed results that has sent the stock ripping and roaring by nearly 20% higher. How should investors be looking at the broader tech trade coming off of Tesla's results? "In the short to medium term, though, it is a trade play. And I think if [Tesla stock] approaches and closes high above a $260, $265 level, I think you buy it because I think it's going all the way to $300," EquitySet CEO Tony Zipparro tells Wealth's Alexandra Canal. "However, if it kind of stops right, pauses, I think it's going all the way down to $200." Expanding the conversation to rest of the Magnificent Seven, Zipparro views declining revenue and deteriorating consumer fundamentals as the biggest risks for names like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META). Zipparro elaborates on trends in investors rotating out of Big Tech and how investors can remain defensive around volatility fueled by the 2024 election.

Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise after the electric vehicle (EV) maker kicked off “Magnificent Seven” earnings. With Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) earnings on deck, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss whether IBM or Tesla earnings are a better indicator of what investors should expect of Big Tech earnings. Morgan explains that IBM’s earnings were mixed but ultimately supported the AI story, “The IBM number wasn't bad. They obviously missed on revenues. But I think the expectations coming into that third quarter report were extremely elevated … It's really kind of a mixed report because they did say they generated about $3 billion in revenues directly from generative AI, and of course, everyone's really focused on that.” While IBM’s mixed results send the stock lower, Tesla, which also reported mixed results, soars. Morgan says he thinks of Tesla as being “kind of clumped into” the Magnificent Seven group. “Personally, I don't see how Tesla fits into that group. To me, they're an automaker, but they seem to be rolled into the tech group.” He notes that the positive reaction to Tesla’s earnings adds to the “good momentum” that comes into Big Tech's earnings. Big Tech earnings offer insights into how companies are spending on tech and their macro-level outlook. Morgan says that macroeconomic conditions continue to affect Big Tech spending as companies cut tech spending during heightened recession fears. He adds that the IBM report did have “some indication” of a slowdown of tech spending, with the IBM CEO saying, “One of the reasons why they fell up short in their consulting segment was the fact that CIOs are using money that would have been designated for consulting, and they're moving that into AI. They're not populating both. So we are seeing little bits of evidence that we may see some slowdown.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

Ayako Yoshioka, Wealth Enhancement Group senior portfolio manager, joins Morning Brief to discuss what these results mean for the rest of the Magnificent Seven earnings and overall market leadership heading into 2025. Yoshioka explains that there is a greater emphasis on tech sector earnings given its concentration in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and weight within the Magnificent Seven. However, she notes that CapEx (capital expenditures) spending among hyperscalers will determine their leadership position moving forward. She tells Yahoo Finance, "I think they're going to evaluate it at some point and see whether or not they need to continue at the pace that they've been at over the last few quarters." With AI still being early in its development, Yoshioka argues that it's "going to be a while" before seeing real competition among hyperscalers and chip companies.

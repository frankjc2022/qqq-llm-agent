RBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst Brad Erickson joins Asking for a Trend to break down the state of the AI trade and the technology's outlook amid a heated competition. Erickson explains that generative AI platforms are emerging "right in front of us," pointing to software engineering efficiencies, customer support platforms, and marketing tools as examples. He also highlights sovereign AI, where countries are spending on the technology to use and access data that no one else has. He adds, "If you look at like the top four or five CapEx spenders on AI infrastructure, it's $200 billion and it's going up next year probably by more than 10%." He explains that investors are in a position where they have to put "blind faith" into AI players, knowing that it will pay off in the future. He tells Yahoo Finance, "From my perspective, like we're taking a little bit more of a measured approach, saying, 'Look, $200 billion. Think about what you need to do to maintain operating margins.' Pretty simple math of, like, are we really talking about $300, $400 billion of marginal revenue every single year? Those are big numbers." Erickson believes that competing AI tools from names like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and OpenAI will ultimately "end up looking a lot of the same kind of thing." He argues that distribution is a more important factor and will likely determine the level of success.

KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to discuss the state of the overall AI race and some of the key players in the sector. After Nvidia rose 8% intraday, Vinh believes the movement indicates "a recovery based on kind of an overreaction on earnings." While Nvidia's most recent earnings met and beat expectations, investors were still disappointed as they looked for bigger returns. However, Vinh doesn't think the AI trade is stopping anytime soon: "I think what really drove the recovery you're seeing more recently is that Oracle (ORCL) came out talked about very strong accelerating growth on the AI side. And they also said that their outlook for next year is going to result in a doubling of capex. So I think that's reassuring investors that the AI trade is not over yet." He argues that Oracle is "one of the key important reads in terms of AI hyperscaler demand and spend going forward." He also points to AMD (AMD), Marvell (MRVL), and Broadcom (AVGO) as standout names in the "expansive market" and highlights Cirrus Logic (CRUS) as a lesser-known play. He calls the company a "proxy for Apple (AAPL)," noting that 80% of its revenue is Apple-driven. As the tech giant rolls out Apple Intelligence, Cirrus Logic will be a beneficiary, especially if it kicks off an upgrade cycle. While the AI race shows no signs of stopping, Vinh expects spending to be "unabated" as data centers become a crucial part of the equation. He explains, "What we look at in our perspective, at least in the near to medium term, at least going into 2025, is that all these AI hyperscalers are going to have to aggressively spend. The next-generation platform that Nvidia is releasing, Blackwell, is going to basically lower your TCO (total cost of ownership) by 30x." "So if we're still waiting for that monetization model, operationally, if you're a hyperscaler, you've got to go with the lowest cost TCO solution out there until you get that monetization model. So we don't see any sort of letup in spend over the next 12 months here," he concludes. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

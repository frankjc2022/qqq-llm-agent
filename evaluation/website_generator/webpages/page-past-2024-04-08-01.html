According to a new report from Charles Schwab, these tech leaders continue to remain popular among retail investors going forward. Charles Schwab Director of Trading and Education Joe Mazzola joins The Morning Brief to discuss why these companies remain popular amongst retail investors and takes a look at potential trends for the upcoming earnings season that may impact these stocks. Mazzola expands upon the report and why these stocks remain popular: "I think with Nvidia, you can make case that AI remains strong amongst the investor base. They want to participate in that, and Nvidia is the leader of the pack. And I think with Apple and Tesla... retail investors tend to look for buying opportunities for names that they've owned in the past. And when you look at the performance of those two names, clear under performers in the Mag. 7 at this point, they're looking for chances to buy those stocks at a discount from where they were trading just three months ago."

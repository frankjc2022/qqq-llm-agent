While Alphabet still heavily depends on ad sales, the company’s new growth engine is Google Cloud.

Munoz points to Tesla (TSLA) as a good buy, explaining that the company's autonomous driving initiatives will be key to its next phase of growth. While other companies, like Waymo, are rolling out their own robotaxis, Munoz believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition as it has much more data to train its vehicles. However, he points to potential regulatory and policy risks down the line. He also highlights its improving financials, believing the company has "a lot of cash to deliver on their product roadmap." He expects third quarter deliveries to come in between 460,000 and 470,000. Munoz notes that Tesla is "not just a car company." He is bullish on its energy businesses, highlighting the "explosive" second quarter revenue growth. "That's something that gets us excited away from just the selling of vehicles. And the auto industry has had some struggles over the last couple of years in this macro environment, but also with higher rates. So their diversified business lines and revenue there gets us very excited," he explains. Meanwhile, Munoz is bearish on Rivian (RIVN), telling Yahoo Finance, "They need a lot of cash. This is a scale industry, and very recently, this summer, they partnered with Volkswagen (VWAGY). They got $5 billion to roll out the next phase of their growth, which is lower-cost vehicles. And so this is something that we're looking at. It's an unprofitable business. They lose money for every car that they make, and we're in an environment where consumers have preferences and there are options." In addition, Rivian is facing production challenges. Last month, the company paused the production of its electric delivery vehicles for Amazon (AMZN) —one of its biggest customers. Munoz also notes that production declined last quarter, and while it appears as if the company will meet its targets, it's enough to make him feel "uncomfortable." Finally, he argues that Rivian's offerings are not only narrow but too expensive relative to other EV players. Coupled with production challenges, he adds, "They have to get these vehicles out to market to get sales to drive revenue, to hopefully become a profitable company. And they expect to do that by 2026. We don't know if they're going to make it." Munoz concludes, "If they can lower their cost, if they can leverage their partnership with Volkswagen, and they can crank production up and get cars on the streets, I think that would be really positive for Rivian over the long run."

Over the majority of Cornell’s tenure, Target has held its own against rivals Amazon (AMZN), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT). Cornell led the company to a revenue increase of nearly 50% from 2015 to 2022, peaking at over $109B as part of a pandemic-related spending surge. Since that peak, Target sales and profits have dipped due to a decline in discretionary spending among consumers, and other factors, including retail theft. In 2022 alone, inventory shrinkage, mostly in the form of retail theft, shaved off $700M from the company’s profits. Following a wave of high-profile ‘smash and grabs,’ including several at Target stores, Target and other retailers have leaned in to increased security and technology to not only reduce and deter theft but to make stores safer and more accessible for customers. These efforts, along with government involvement, are already having an impact, according to Cornell. “I feel so much better today than I did a year ago, and I think it comes back to support at the federal level, at the state level and at the local level,” Cornell says. “To be clear, we do not like locking up product, but we like running stores and we want to keep our stores open. We want to make sure they're safe.” For more of the full conversation with Cornell, tune into Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday, Sept. 26 at 10:30 a.m. ET.

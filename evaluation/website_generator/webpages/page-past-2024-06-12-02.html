Joining Asking for A Trend is Dialpad founder and CEO Craig Walker, who sheds light on how his company aims to empower businesses to harness the power of AI to boost efficiency. Walker notes that Dialpad's efforts are focused on "taking all of business communications and analyzing it in real-time." This real-time analysis allows for identifying customer trends, ultimately enabling businesses to optimize productivity and efficiency within their organizations. He emphasizes that the goal is "all about making the most modern communications platform," leveraging AI to provide businesses with insights into "business conversations." "Last year was the year of hype around AI, this year is the year AI becomes real, and then next year and beyond is when the winners really, really start to monetize the AI," Walker tells Yahoo Finance.

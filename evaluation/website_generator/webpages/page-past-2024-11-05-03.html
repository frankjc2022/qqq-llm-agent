The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. "Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location." Fox outlines, "Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?"

The controversial plan mandating workers come to Amazon offices every day starting next year, up from three days now, has caused consternation among employees who say it is stricter than other tech companies and will hinder efficiency because of commuting times.  "A number of people I've seen theorized that the reason we were doing this is, it's a backdoor layoff, or we made some sort of deal with city or cities," said Jassy, according to a transcript of the meeting reviewed by Reuters.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Tracking Baillie Gifford's 13F Portfolio - Q3 2024 Update</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-11-05 20:13:09+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Baillie Gifford's diverse $134B portfolio sees stake increases in high-growth companies like Shopify, Sea Ltd., and Microsoft.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Hyperscaler Capex to Reach $300 Billion in 2025: Morgan Stanley</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-11-05 20:09:30+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Spending is primarily driven by investments in generative AI and large language models</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Hyperscaler Giants Project $300B Capex in 2025, Driven by AI Growth</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-11-05 20:09:01+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Hyperscaler capex expected to hit $300B by 2025, driven by AI and cloud infrastructure growth</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Amazon Gets Approval to Fly New Delivery Drone.

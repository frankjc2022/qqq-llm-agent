Pernas Research Co-Founder Deiya Pernas and Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney join Market Domination to discuss the state of index investing. Pernas believes investors' biggest worry should be "complacency" in the indexes. "The market's trading at 21 times forward. and it's somewhat typical of late-cycle that you see large cap quality do quite well and that's what we've seen this year," Pernas elaborates, pointing out small cap equities' value growth is flat and may not be participating in market rallies. "If you look at it holistically, there's some areas of the market where cracks are evident, but again, at the index level, I think there's a lot of complacency." "Tere's a lot of examples this earnings season, especially in technology, so we don't need to be near airlines and autos or retailers or some of these other ones that are mentioned. We don't need to be in those industries," Mahoney explains, later going on to discuss big names in tech. "We're in the fast lane, we're growth managers. We accept the bumpy ride in the left lane, but that's where all the CapEx spending, that's where the excitement is. The multiples can expand when we have this type of opportunity..."

Wiley highlights the importance of Nvidia's earnings: "Nvidia drives Mag 7, Mag 7 drives the market." He acknowledges that Nvidia "blew it out of the water" with its results. However, he notes that Big Tech has been "a weak spot in the market" despite Nvidia's value proposition. Despite the recent pressure on Big Tech and the "Magnificent 7," Wiley remains optimistic about these stocks' long-term prospects: "[They] have fundamental reasons to keep growing and to keep driving the markets ... If you under-allocate, you're in big trouble." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

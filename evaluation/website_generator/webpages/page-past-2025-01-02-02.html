After all, the company has pretty much the biggest everything nowadays. The chip giant is sporting a $3.4+ trillion market cap, due largely to its foundational position in the ongoing AI boom. Companies like OpenAI and Meta have purchased Nvidia processors by the boatload, and that’s unlikely to change in the new year.

Bajarin names several of the typical players in the AI semiconductor space contributing to infrastructure, namely Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell Technology (MRVL). "A ton of growth still going on the infrastructure side, so I imagine that that that will continue," Bajarin states. "We're going to continue to see a tremendous amount of demand for compute, that's not going away. But I think what I'm looking for in 2025 is the software monetization of those stocks." Bajarin also weighs in on the reported boost in productivity from executives after deploying AI agents across several industries, as well as what is to be expected on cloud computing spend and Apple's (AAPL) AI-enabled computers and smart devices.

"We see significant upside once the delivery numbers ramp up. We think they're going to be able to exceed $200 billion in revenue just from this product launch for this year," Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska forecasts. Delevska joins Madison Mills in the Yahoo Finance studio to talk about this year's prospects for the artificial intelligence landscape, including her bull cases for semiconductor competitors Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). "Now we are getting into a phase where we need physical build-out of data centers and power associated with them. And the US has gone through a period of time where the power infrastructure has not really been upgraded, both on the grid and the generation side," Delevska says about the role energy providers like Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG) will play in powering AI data center infrastructure. "So as we've brought more renewables to market, the reliability is much lower of the grid. So what we're going to see is power prices spike up in order to incentivize new supply coming to market."

However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, "You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion." He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, "The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection." Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. "We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years."

Kinahan tells the Morning Brief team that Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT), and Reddit (RDDT) are the top bullish picks. "[Cisco] is one that I think is really interesting," Kinahan says, adding, "We hear so much about AI ... and what I think people sometimes forget is you really need the networkers also" and, "I think the networking side of it is the most underrated side of what's going on in AI." He notes, "Cisco is really well positioned [and] we've seen our clients and our Tastytrade brokerage side really start to over the last three weeks, particularly, buy this stock." The second name that clients have been "buying significantly" is Microsoft, which Kinahan says is "not a big surprise" given "the fact that it's a darling of retail [investors, it's] usually one of the top three names." "The last one on there [is] Reddit and what we've seen there is not only our clients loving it. I think there was [some] doubt [for] some people if it could compete in the social media context, [but] they've done an incredible job overall of continuing to add users" and have gained bullish calls from analysts. On the other hand, Kinahan says three stocks that have seen bearish trading activity heading into 2025 are Dell Technologies (DELL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and Pfizer (PFE).

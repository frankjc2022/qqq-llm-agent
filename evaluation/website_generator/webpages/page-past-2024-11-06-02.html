Bets that Arm, which licenses its designs, will benefit from a surge in AI computing have more than doubled the chip designer’s share price since its initial public offer last September, giving it a market value of about $144 billion.

Mackenzie Global Quantitative senior vice president Arup Datta joins Wealth! to discuss the implications for investors and their portfolios. "My view on being positive in the markets remains," Datta states, noting outperformance in sectors like small caps after Trump's victory. However, he notes that presidential elections "play less of a role" in long-term impacts on markets in the US. He notes that investors should always have value, growth, and quality stocks in their portfolios, saying you "can't always predict which style will be in favor today, tomorrow, [or] in the next 6 months." Regarding specific stock picks, Datta advises investors to consider Nvidia (NVDA), Comerica (CMA), and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH).

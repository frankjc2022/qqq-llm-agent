Adept said in a blog post Friday that cofounder and CEO David Luan, as well as several other co-founders and employees were leaving to join Amazon.  The San Francisco-based startup, which has raised over $410 million and is valued above $1 billion, already named a new CEO.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Amazon is reviewing whether Perplexity AI improperly scraped online content</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-06-28 21:11:06+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Amazon is reviewing claims that the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI is scraping content — including from prominent news sites — without approval.

He explains how Amazon Web Services is benefiting from AI demand and points to Amazon’s cost-cutting and efficiency measures as another tailwind.  On the other hand, Rhind would avoid Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), citing disappointing third quarter earnings, consumer weakness concerns, and the lack of an AI story against the challenges of the traditional retail model.

Musk's next battle will be convincing a Delaware judge to ratify the compensation package after a Delaware judge struck the original 2018 pay package down earlier this year. This victory marks yet another chief executive who has defied the odds and are pushing the boundaries of their own compensation parameters. Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy Lecturer Gautam Mukunda sits down with Yahoo Finance to discuss the massive growth and shifts in CEO pay, which he describes at being levels not seen since the Second Industrial Revolution in the late 19th Century. "The Gilded Age was followed by an age of the Progressive ERA, ages of reform, when you are in the United States, where median income has basically stagnated for about 45 years, I think people are going to push back and say, does it make a lot of sense for however valuable you might think a CEO is?" the Picking Presidents Author asks, later adding: "It would not be surprising for society to push on that and say, well, it is time for there to be a reform movement to get this under, to get this rebalanced in a way that's healthier for the rest of us." Referring to Musk's own pay package at Tesla, Mukunda plainly states: "Presumably, if he asks for a bigger one, he's going to have to generate the same kind of returns that he did before. Given Tesla's current market cap, it's in almost half $1 trillion." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are mixed after June's consumer sentiment data hit its lowest level since November. CFRA Research chief investment strategist Sam Stovall is concerned that markets may have "to endure another decline" before the following year sees substantial market gains. Tesla shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk's controversial $56 billion compensation package at Thursday's shareholder meeting. Financial analyst and YouTuber "Meet Kevin" Kevin Paffrath was in favor of Musk's pay package, explaining, "the deal was made in 2018 and it was very public... Frankly, if that same deal was made today at those prices then, everybody would look at that as a shareholder and go — well, at least 70% like we had then — 'Of course, we're going to support if you can move the market capitalization of this stock essentially exponentially. Of course, we're going to support paying for you.' So receiving that and then being frustrated about Elon in the short term, I don't think is fair. I think it hits on an element of justice." As the summer travel season heats up, top cruise line stocks (CCL, RCL, NCLH, VIK) dipped in Friday's session after Bank of America analysts found cruise prices to be "modestly softer" in June. On the airline side, issues with Boeing (BA) are preventing companies from accessing new planes, stunting growth amid high demand. Peter McNally, Third Bridge Global's Head of Industrials, Materials, and Energy Sector, explains, "companies like United (UAL) who've got very ambitious targets out to 2026 that they've had to temper that a bit... It doesn't seem like Boeing's problems are going to be sorted anytime soon, and it's not like Airbus (AIR.PA) can go any faster than they already are." Shares of Shopify (SHOP) rose after Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney upgraded the e-commerce company to Outperform from In Line, citing an attractive entry point for investors following a slight decline in the share price. Tempus AI (TEM) shares also popped after making its trading debut on the Nasdaq via an IPO.

It was worth more early in the year, but Tesla's stock value has fallen about 25% since then.  The all-stock package, approved by the board and shareholders in 2018, rewards Musk for hitting milestones that include raising Tesla's market value, pretax income and revenue.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>The Score: Paramount, Apple, Tesla and More Stocks That Defined the Week</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-06-14 21:53:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>An activist investor wants to overhaul Southwest.

The firm called for replacing Chief Executive  Bob Jordan  with an external candidate and overhauling the board at Southwest, and for management to lead a comprehensive business review.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>EV competitors like Ford, GM are 'scared' of Tesla: Investor</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-06-14 20:50:52+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Tesla (TSLA) shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk's controversial $56 billion compensation package, as well as other measures at Thursday's shareholder meeting. Financial analyst and YouTuber "Meet Kevin" Kevin Paffrath joins Market Domination to discuss the shareholder meeting and the future of the EV company under Musk's leadership. "The shareholder vote now behind us is great news. It's a big negative catalyst away for Tesla," Paffrath explains. He says that Musk's vision of full self-driving (FSD) is "probably going to be a lot safer for the entire world," as "we [go] toward an autonomous future." However, Paffrath doubts whether it will happen as quickly as Musk suggests.  Regardless, Paffrath says he's bullish on the stock in the next two to four years as the company "still has probably the best moat in full self-driving that exists." Paffrath's Pricing Power ETF (PP) holds just 36,000 Tesla shares in its portfolio. Paffrath was in favor of Musk's pay package, stating, "the deal was made in 2018 and it was very public... Frankly, if that same deal was made today at those prices then, everybody would look at that as a shareholder and go — well, at least 70% like we had then — 'Of course, we're going to support if you can move the market capitalization of this stock essentially exponentially. Of course, we're going to support paying for you.' So receiving that and then being frustrated about Elon in the short term, I don't think is fair. I think it hits on an element of justice." He adds that after the company started offering consumers a lower monthly payment, he expects Tesla shares to skyrocket and "form a bottom here in delivery numbers." "So really, what Elon's doing here is he's creating a bottoming process in the actual manufacturing of electric vehicles. At the same time, he's rehired back the charging team, which is great, most of them, at least. And all of the other electric vehicle companies that I'm studying — Ford (F), GM (GM) — they're all scared," he explains.

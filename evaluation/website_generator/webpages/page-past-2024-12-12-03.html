"The 65-plus population surge, the silver tsunami, is really significant. So by 2050, you are going to have nearly a quarter of the population that is 65 or older. That's up from 18% right now," Thomas says, explaining, "There are huge implications, in big ways and then in everyday ways." Thomas goes on to say that "at a macro level, you have to think about things like home renovation because nearly 75% of the people that we've spoken to in that cohort do plan to or hope to age in [their] home, and so there's a huge amount of home renovation that's going on as they modify their homes to make way for aging in place... And when you think that that's a $1 trillion market in North American home renovation, we think that under some scenarios, that could continue to grow another 5% or 6%." "On the everyday side of the spectrum, one thing that came out of our work is coffee. So it turns out when you get older, you drink more coffee," Thomas explains, connecting this experience with the reason why coffee chain Dutch Bros. (BROS) is among TD Cowen's "best ideas for 2025.

I'm also starting to warm up to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) because it's come down a lot.

New York University Law Professor Harry First joins Market Domination to discuss the likelihood of these remedies being implemented. First suggests that "the odds are medium" for the judge to rule in favor of breaking up the tech giant, noting there are "several hurdles" to overcome, outlining three big steps: First, the government plaintiffs "have to actually ask" for a break-up; second, the judge trying the case must agree, though First notes the judge will likely be "cautious"; and finally, the judge will need to convince a court of appeals to support such a decision. The discussion draws parallels between this case and a similar antitrust suit filed levied against Microsoft (MSFT) in 2000, with First providing detailed insights.

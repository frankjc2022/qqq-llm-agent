The chip company is expected to report earnings per share of about $5.22, which will be a 406% year-over-year increase. Mahn says he expects Nvidia to announce more data centers, a critical component of the AI ecosystem. He adds that there's a unique opportunity in energy companies, as data centers alone are estimated to consume about 10% of the country's electricity by 2030. Mahn says that Nvidia "could be the ultimate winner of the AI race," as it promises 25 times less cost and less electricity use in its new Blackwell chips. "Nvidia is trying to go beyond just chips and offer the whole packaged AI solution, plus getting more CapEx spending in data centers. They're not stopping here and they're only going to continue to grow," he adds. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said he favors holding higher interest rates for longer, needing several months of favorable inflation data before pursuing rate cuts. Hennion & Walsh chief investment officer Kevin Mahn warns that this could be a slippery slope: "I think the Fed needs to be careful because if they keep rates too high for too long, they risk their own forecasted economic slowdown moving into a recessionary period." Microsoft's (MSFT) Build event kicked off with a series of announcements, like new plans to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o into its Azure AI Studio offering. This is the tech giant's latest artificial intelligence push to make it a key competitor as the AI race heats up. Ethereum (ETH-USD) prices are surging amid renewed optimism of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving an ether ETF. Similar action in the crypto market was also seen in the lead-up to the SEC's decision on spot bitcoin ETFs at the start of 2024. Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan expresses confidence, stating that the odds for a spot ether ETF approval are "up above 80% before the end of the year." On the retail front, Lowe's (LOW) and Macy's (M) both topped earnings expectations. However, shares of Lowe's are falling after the home improvement retailer saw a pullback among consumers in the do-it-yourself (DIY) segment, with sales in that category declining. Meanwhile, shares of Macy's are climbing after the company raised its full-year guidance amid weak consumer spending.

All eyes are on the chip maker as Wall Street analysts expect its latest figures could be the next big 2024 market catalyst. Niles Investment Management Founder and Portfolio Manager Dan Niles joins Josh Lipton on Yahoo Finance's Asking for a Trend to talk about the trajectory of Nvidia's stock going into this earnings print — up already 98% year-to-date — and the timeline of its new Blackwell GPU. "And if you think about the prior quarter, expectations were sky-high going into that as well and the stock still rallied about 16% after the print," Niles says. "Today was interesting in that you got a headline that I would have thought would have knocked the stock down, which was Amazon Web Services confirming through a spokesperson that they were taking some of the orders they had for the current generation of chips and moving those to the next generation of chips coming out called Blackwell, which comes out later this year."

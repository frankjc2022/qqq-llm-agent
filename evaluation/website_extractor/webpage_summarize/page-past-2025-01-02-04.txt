Tesla has faced challenges, reporting a decline in vehicle sales for the first time in 2024, attributed to decreased demand and increased competition in the electric vehicle market. Despite this, Tesla's energy storage business has shown promise, with analysts suggesting that the introduction of more affordable models could help the company regain market momentum. The company's fourth-quarter delivery numbers fell short of expectations, leading to concerns about investor fatigue.

This transition comes as major corporations, including Meta, align themselves with the incoming Trump administration, raising concerns about the implications of corporate support for political figures.

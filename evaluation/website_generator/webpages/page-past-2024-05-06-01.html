CFRA Vice President of Equity Research Cathy Seifert joins Wealth!  to give insight into Warren Buffett's appearance and the key takeaways from his remarks. "I think investors can take away two key tenants: diversification and time is on your side. [Buffett] is not an active trader, he's definitely a buy-and-hold sort of investor," Seifert points out. "I think people might have been a little surprised at the large slug of Apple (AAPL) stock that Berkshire sold. I think that's an appropriate rebalancing, given how well the stock had done for the company. I mean, it hasn't done that great this year, but historically for Berkshire, it's done well."

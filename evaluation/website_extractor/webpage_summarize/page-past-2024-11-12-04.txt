Co-founded by former Neuralink employees, the company is developing a high-bandwidth BCI that is designed to be safe and reversible, potentially transforming how people with conditions like ALS communicate and function.

Meta Platforms is also in the spotlight, with significant investments in artificial intelligence driving its growth.

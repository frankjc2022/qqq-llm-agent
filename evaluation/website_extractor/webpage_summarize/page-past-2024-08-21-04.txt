The National Transportation Safety Board has initiated an investigation into a crash and fire involving a Tesla electric semi-truck on a California highway. This incident follows the resignation of a Tesla veteran, Sreela Venkataratnam, leaving only one woman in a VP role at the company. Meanwhile, Lucid Motors, another California-based electric vehicle manufacturer, is focusing on its upcoming Gravity SUV, which is seen as crucial for the company's future. The CEO of Lucid expressed confidence that the upcoming presidential elections could favor the EV industry, despite Elon Musk's support for Donald Trump.

Tesla's financial performance has been notable, with annual revenue increasing from $20 billion pre-COVID-19 to $95 billion in trailing twelve months. Analysts, including Jim Cramer, have encouraged investors to consider Tesla shares ahead of significant events like the Robitaxi launch. However, Tesla has faced challenges, including a 7% drop in auto revenue and a 45% decline in quarterly profit, attributed to price cuts and low-interest loans.

In the broader market context, stocks have been affected by economic data and central bank policy shifts. Companies like Nvidia are recovering from earlier sell-offs, contributing to a tech sector rally. Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, is also navigating challenges, including a significant settlement over facial recognition technology and the discontinuation of a misinformation tracking tool. Despite these hurdles, Meta is investing in AI tools and expanding its agreements with partners like Universal Music Group.

Overall, the electric vehicle and tech sectors are experiencing significant developments, with companies adapting to market pressures and regulatory challenges.

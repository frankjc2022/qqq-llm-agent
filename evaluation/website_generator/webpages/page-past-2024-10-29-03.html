Tech players have begun investing in nuclear energy developers to find the clean energy output needed to power these expansions. Oklo Inc. (OKLO) is one of these names benefitting from the trend, its stock having jumped nearly 200% over the past month. The nuclear startup is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who is also Oklo's chairman. Oklo Co-Founder and CEO Jake DeWitte joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to talk about the long-term investments in small modular reactors (SMR) and the intricacies of these systems; Oklo doesn't expect to finish building its first SMR and producing power from it until 2027. "When you split an atom, you get almost 50 million-times more energy than when you combust like a molecule of natural gas or so. It's incredible," DeWitte tells Yahoo Finance. "What that means, then, is there's a lot of energy in nuclear fuel. And actually in almost all reactors, you only use about 5% of the fuel in one pass through the reactor. And there's reasons why long story short, is you could put more fuel in, it could run for longer. But that comes at increased cost for the added systems you would need to manage all that." US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm told Yahoo Finance that her department's focus will be on ensuring these AI data centers are powered by clean energy, while understanding the challenge in widespread SMR adoption: "Nobody wants to be the one to buy the first one." Oklo has already inked energy partnerships with date center providersw Equinix (EQIX) and Wyoming Hyperscale. DeWitte describes the regular business model for nuclear systems as "clunky." "One of the things that we set out to do in the beginning was, was make it easier to buy what people really want from nuclear systems, in other words, make it easier to buy nuclear power because the clean, reliable, affordable power, that's the stuff people really want," DeWitte explains. "We're unique because we actually make that easy — we design, we own, we operate the plants, we contract someone to build them, and then we just sell the power out to the customers through off-take agreements. That makes it easy for them to buy what they want."

Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna sits down with Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to discuss what investors need to see from Big Tech companies' quarterly results and the broader market impact. The strategist explains that he expects Big Tech companies’ earnings to moderate from their recent rapid growth. “Everybody keeps focusing nowadays on [the] broadening of earnings and how Big Tech moderating is not necessarily bad. That's the half-glass-full kind of situation.” “Historically, when Big Tech multiples have corrected, correlations have increased with the rest of the market. So, in other words, you're not immune outside.” He notes that the expectations for Big Tech have been set high, given their overperformance in recent quarters. Krishna says an earnings beat 5% to 6% above Wall Street estimates is “reasonable,” while “Anything less than that, I would be disappointed. Anything above that is phenomenal. They will be back in complete control compared to the rest of the market.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

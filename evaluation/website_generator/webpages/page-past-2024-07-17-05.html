The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sunk by 512 points — or 2.77% — in Wednesday's trading session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also closed 1.39% lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) saw a 0.60% bump higher to a new record high. Markets have taken a turn as the Russell 2000 (^RUT) makes gains while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lag from pressure facing the chip sector. Kestra Investment Management CIO Kara Murphy says, "If you look at over the last six months, 80% of the constituents of the S&P 500 have underperformed the index... Now all of a sudden, we get a couple of good inflation prints, a couple good labor prints. Looks like Fed can start to cut interest rates, and all of a sudden, the macro environment starts to change. And I think this is a hint of what is going to turn out to be a broader trend." She encourages investors to start rotating out some mega-cap names for some smaller-cap and mid-cap names, explaining that with mid-caps, "you have companies that are a little bit more established, a little bit more mature, a little bit more diversified, better balance sheets in general, but largely ignored by a lot of the market." United Airlines (UAL) posted mixed second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.14 topped estimates of $3.93. Operating revenue of $15.0 billion was about in line with the estimated $15.04 billion, but passenger revenue of $13.68 billion was just shy of the expected $13.74 billion. The airliner disappointed with its third quarter outlook, projecting adjusted earnings of $2.75 to $3.25 per share, coming in below the anticipated $3.38. Third Bridge global sector lead for industrials, materials, and energy Peter McNally explains, "most of the market has gotten this heads up now that the airline industry is softening. There's just too much capacity right now and we're at a peak demand season. And it's weighing on the revenues outlook." He adds, "it gets more interesting for United longer term," as capital expenditures seem lower year-over-year and Boeing's (BA) deliveries slow. He notes that United's future plans depend on getting new planes from Boeing, and he's keeping a watchful eye on how those plans get pushed. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is currently in talks to by cybersecurity firm Wiz for a deal valued around $23 billion, according to Bloomberg. As the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have been recently pushing back on a number of Big Tech deals, Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Keenan breaks down why a potential Alphabet-Wiz deal is unlikely to evade regulator scrutiny. Finally, Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down what to watch on Thursday, July 18, from the end of the Republican National Convention to major earnings including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Netflix (NFLX).

The Russell 2000 (^RUT) has risen by more than 10% in the last five trading sessions, marking the longest streak of gains for the small-cap index since April 2020. MAI Capital Management chief equity strategist Chris Grisanti believes that small caps are still "underpriced" despite the Russell 2000 having "its biggest move in terms of standard deviations that we've seen in more than 30 years over the last week." He adds that small-cap stocks are cheap buying opportunities: "I don't think it's too late to initiate positions if you haven't already." Retail stocks are on the move as shares of Five Below (FIVE) sink nearly 20% after the retailer announced its CEO Joel Anderson is resigning. The retailer also lowered its second quarter guidance. Meanwhile, shares of Vans parent company VF Corporation (VFC) are jumping on reports that the apparel company will be selling its Supreme brand to European eyewear brand EssilorLuxottica (EL.PA, ESLOY) for $1.5 billion. Paramount Global's (PARA, PARAA) plans to merge with Skydance Media have left investors pondering whether more M&A deals could be in the media landscape's future. As part of this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special, Market Domination host Josh Lipton breaks down analysts' forecasts for mergers and acquisitions in the media industry and the potential headwinds media companies face as the 2024 presidential election nears. LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield believes that "no major M&A would happen this year, and I think that's what played out," believing media M&A deals such as Paramount's merger with Skydance will be finalized in 2025 due to regulatory concerns.

"We feel that these companies should be a core position in the portfolio. No doubt about that, right? And potentially, the earnings will be good as well. But it's all about expectations. So again, in the short term for the retail investor, very difficult to predict," Zaman says. He explains that the concentration of more than 20% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lies in three stocks, which investors want to hold on to. However, he advises that "no individual stocks should be more than 5% of the portfolio, and invest in other areas of the market to protect yourselves." Focusing on Tesla (TSLA), Zaman notes that despite the stock's volatility, "in the long term it's going to do well." In order to navigate this dynamic, he encourages investors to limit their exposure "and be exposed to it in a very diversified way."

The European Commission last month said it would send requests for information to better understand the effects of the deal which would see Samsung embed Google's Gemini Nano in Samsung's Galaxy S24 series smartphones.  Regulators also wanted to know if the pre-installation of Gemini Nano limits interoperability between other chatbots and apps pre-installed on Samsung smartphones.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Should media companies be so focused on M&A, consolidation?</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-17 16:23:59+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav (WBD) made comments over "real consolidation" that will take place with media companies over the next few years. Streaming giants have faced many challenges lately with their subscription models but could there be more challenges for the industry ahead? LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield joins Catalysts for this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special to weigh in on the challenges major media companies face with consolidation. Greenfield begins by laying out the problem the older media companies are facing: "the amount of usage of applications like Peacock (CMCSA) or Paramount Plus (PARA) Plus or even Max pales in comparison to what is happening at Netflix (NFLX) let alone YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL)... Netflix and YouTube, represent over 45% of all time spent streaming on a television. That's just two players dominating. No one ever dominated linear TV the way Netflix and YouTube dominate streaming TV. And that's a huge problem." Greenfield holds firm to his forecast that "no major M&A would happen this year, and I think that's what played out," believing media M&A deals such as Paramount's merger with Skydance will be finalized in 2025 due to regulatory concerns. "In general, the Republican Party should be more pro-consolidation. Maybe not so much pro-tech... Obviously, former President Trump has certainly made some pretty aggressive comments about his feelings on Facebook and 'Zuckerbucks.' But, you know, the reality is I do think you're going to see forms of consolidation..."

The Russell 2000 (^RUT) has risen by more than 10% in the last five trading sessions, marking the longest streak of gains for the small-cap index since April 2020. MAI Capital Management chief equity strategist Chris Grisanti believes that small caps are still "underpriced" despite the Russell 2000 having "its biggest move in terms of standard deviations that we've seen in more than 30 years over the last week." He adds that small-cap stocks are cheap buying opportunities: "I don't think it's too late to initiate positions if you haven't already." Retail stocks are on the move as shares of Five Below (FIVE) sink nearly 20% after the retailer announced its CEO Joel Anderson is resigning. The retailer also lowered its second quarter guidance. Meanwhile, shares of Vans parent company VF Corporation (VFC) are jumping on reports that the apparel company will be selling its Supreme brand to European eyewear brand EssilorLuxottica (EL.PA, ESLOY) for $1.5 billion. Paramount Global's (PARA, PARAA) plans to merge with Skydance Media have left investors pondering whether more M&A deals could be in the media landscape's future. As part of this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special, Market Domination host Josh Lipton breaks down analysts' forecasts for mergers and acquisitions in the media industry and the potential headwinds media companies face as the 2024 presidential election nears. LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield believes that "no major M&A would happen this year, and I think that's what played out," believing media M&A deals such as Paramount's merger with Skydance will be finalized in 2025 due to regulatory concerns.

"We feel that these companies should be a core position in the portfolio. No doubt about that, right? And potentially, the earnings will be good as well. But it's all about expectations. So again, in the short term for the retail investor, very difficult to predict," Zaman says. He explains that the concentration of more than 20% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lies in three stocks, which investors want to hold on to. However, he advises that "no individual stocks should be more than 5% of the portfolio, and invest in other areas of the market to protect yourselves." Focusing on Tesla (TSLA), Zaman notes that despite the stock's volatility, "in the long term it's going to do well." In order to navigate this dynamic, he encourages investors to limit their exposure "and be exposed to it in a very diversified way."

The European Commission last month said it would send requests for information to better understand the effects of the deal which would see Samsung embed Google's Gemini Nano in Samsung's Galaxy S24 series smartphones.  Regulators also wanted to know if the pre-installation of Gemini Nano limits interoperability between other chatbots and apps pre-installed on Samsung smartphones.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Should media companies be so focused on M&A, consolidation?</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-17 16:23:59+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav (WBD) made comments over "real consolidation" that will take place with media companies over the next few years. Streaming giants have faced many challenges lately with their subscription models but could there be more challenges for the industry ahead? LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield joins Catalysts for this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special to weigh in on the challenges major media companies face with consolidation. Greenfield begins by laying out the problem the older media companies are facing: "the amount of usage of applications like Peacock (CMCSA) or Paramount Plus (PARA) Plus or even Max pales in comparison to what is happening at Netflix (NFLX) let alone YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL)... Netflix and YouTube, represent over 45% of all time spent streaming on a television. That's just two players dominating. No one ever dominated linear TV the way Netflix and YouTube dominate streaming TV. And that's a huge problem." Greenfield holds firm to his forecast that "no major M&A would happen this year, and I think that's what played out," believing media M&A deals such as Paramount's merger with Skydance will be finalized in 2025 due to regulatory concerns. "In general, the Republican Party should be more pro-consolidation. Maybe not so much pro-tech... Obviously, former President Trump has certainly made some pretty aggressive comments about his feelings on Facebook and 'Zuckerbucks.' But, you know, the reality is I do think you're going to see forms of consolidation..."

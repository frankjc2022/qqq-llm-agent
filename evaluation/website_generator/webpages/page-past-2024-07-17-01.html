Nintendo exec talks game industry 'poised for an upswing'</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-17 22:19:21+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>The video game industry is reaching outside of its comfort zone as audiences are seeing exposure to more video game adaptations, TV series, M&A activity between studios, and even partnerships with popular streaming services. "The overall entertainment industry is large, it's a significant part of the global economy. And gaming is the biggest part of that — it's a $200 billion business today. It's bigger than streaming, bigger than the movie box office. Across the globe, 3 billion people play video games," former Nintendo (NTDOY) of America President and COO Reggie Fils-Aimé explains to Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend. An industry veteran, Fils-Aimé held the positions of Nintendo of America president and COO from 2006 to 2019. He believes the gaming industry is "poised for an upswing" following post-pandemic contractions from game studios and consumers. Fils-Aimé weighs in on rising trends in gaming, including VR and AR headsets (virtual reality and augmented reality) — namely Apple's (AAPL) costly Vision Pro — and cloud gaming technology. Cloud gaming is "just going to be another way that consumers can get access to games in the end, this is an industry that is driven by content," Fils-Aimé says, underlining the fact that it will "always come down to the games" no matter the platform or hardware behind it.

"We feel that these companies should be a core position in the portfolio. No doubt about that, right? And potentially, the earnings will be good as well. But it's all about expectations. So again, in the short term for the retail investor, very difficult to predict," Zaman says. He explains that the concentration of more than 20% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lies in three stocks, which investors want to hold on to. However, he advises that "no individual stocks should be more than 5% of the portfolio, and invest in other areas of the market to protect yourselves." Focusing on Tesla (TSLA), Zaman notes that despite the stock's volatility, "in the long term it's going to do well." In order to navigate this dynamic, he encourages investors to limit their exposure "and be exposed to it in a very diversified way."

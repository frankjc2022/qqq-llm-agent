The chip giant is reportedly facing a delay in its Blackwell AI chips as investors anxiously await returns on AI investments. Wall Street Journal tech columnist Dan Gallagher joins Asking for a Trend to discuss the AI race and how a delay Nvidia's Blackwell chip may impact the chip giant. "It was going to always take a while for generative AI to build up into some kind of business, if it builds up. But all the investment for it has to come before that. And this is a lot of investment, billions and billions of dollars into buying these GPUs, building these new data centers. And so, I think there was always going to be these periods where the spending was going to really outweigh any kind of business or revenue story," Gallagher explains. He notes that despite a possible delay in Nvidia Blackwell chips due to design and performance issues, "a three-month delay is hardly fatal." He explains, "They are ahead of the competition by years. So if it turns out to be like the Blackwell comes out two or three months late, it's really just kind of shifting a little bit of revenue I think more than anything that's fatal." Gallagher adds that across the board, he expects chipmakers to have ambitious goals and move very fast, potentially hitting roadblocks along the way.

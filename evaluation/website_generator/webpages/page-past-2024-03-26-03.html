Laffer Tengler Investments CEO & CIO Nancy Tengler and Great Hill Capital Chairman and Managing Member Thomas Hayes join Yahoo Finance to revisit and update last year's calls. Hayes outlines his market strategy amid a surging market: "We've been publicly bullish nonstop for a year and a half, and we've recently become more cautious. We're up 17 out of the last 21 weeks. No 2% pullback in the last 100 trading days. So, in recent weeks, we put on a 2% hedge: 1% put spreads on the S&P, 1% put spreads on the semiconductor index, and 98% long. So if we're right, those have an expected value of 5x each." Tengler addresses risks on her radar: "We started broadening out the portfolio, really to have the improvement in some of the names that we've seen in healthcare, financials, some of the more cyclical names...But my biggest concern is that the Fed seems to be, I guess, walking away from their data dependence, and I'll put quotes around that, that they've had in the past. And it seems they're determined to cut. We've drawn an analogy to the 90s. We think you can have higher inflation, but not materially higher. So that's my worry, that we get a surge in inflation because the Fed is too easy." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

Here's why.</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-03-26 15:36:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Nvidia (NVDA) partner SK Hynix (000660.KS) plans to invest nearly $4 billion to build an advanced chip-packaging facility in West Lafayette, Indiana, according to a WSJ report. The investment is a boon to President Biden's goal to bring more extensive chip production to the US. TD Cowen Managing Director Matthew Ramsay joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what the investment means for the semiconductor sector. Ramsay explains many of the top chip companies driving the AI and PC market manufacture most of their products in Taiwan. However, SK Hynix's efforts to create an Indiana plant can be seen as a long-term plan to build out manufacturing and other layers of the supply chain in the US and Europe –– changes Ramsay says are "super important for the industry." "Everyone's in this boat together," Ramsay says of chip makers' Taiwan concentration. However, Ramsay notes Intel is also pushing to diversify its manufacturing away from a single hub, having manufactured stateside "for decades." Ramsay adds that Micron could benefit from CHIPS Act funding, a "necessary step for them to regain competitiveness with Nvidia" and other tech names.

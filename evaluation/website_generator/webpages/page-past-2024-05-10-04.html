Sweetgreen (SG) shares soar after the company topped first quarter revenue estimates and raised full-year guidance. Similarly, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) shares are rising after the company reported that its sales jumped nearly 60% year over year, largely due to AI demand. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Managing Director Dan Skelly joins Market Domination to discuss some signs pointing to the Fed potentially cutting interest rates several times before the end of the year. Novavax (NVAX) shares skyrocket after the company announced a $1.2 billion vaccine deal with French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY). B. Riley Securities Managing Director & Group Head of Healthcare Research Mayank Mamtani explains how the partnership marks a "new chapter" for Novavax after a post-pandemic slump. Yahoo Finance reporter Pras Subramanian joins to discuss Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk backpedaling his recent move to shrink the company's Supercharger team. As many legacy automakers signed up to participate in Tesla's Supercharger network, Subramanian says Musk is trying to fix the issue he created after laying off a majority of the Supercharger team. A new edition of Good Buy or Goodbye analyzes two companies in the finance sector: PayPal (PYPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS).

Yahoo Finance reporter Pras Subramanian tells Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman that Musk is "trying to fix the situation or chaos that he created in the first place by basically nearly laying off everyone in that Supercharger team." Many legacy automakers signed up to participate in Tesla's Supercharger network, which Subramanian explains created "a big problem that [Musk] is trying to address right now."

The Autopilot system prevented Hans Von Ohain from being able to keep his Model 3 Tesla on a Colorado road in 2022, according to the lawsuit filed by Nora Bass in state court on May 3.  Von Ohain died after the car hit a tree and burst into flames, but a passenger was able to escape, the suit says.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Protesters attempt to storm Tesla’s factory in Germany</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-05-10 19:40:42+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>As many as 800 activists gathered outside Tesla’s factory near Berlin Friday to protest its expansion plans, and some of them clashed with police as they attempted to break into the plant.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Biden to Hike Chinese EV Tariffs, Report Says.

Artificial intelligence developer OpenAI is reportedly developing an AI-powered search engine that could rival Alphabet's Google (GOOGL, GOOG), and it could drop as early as Monday, May 13 according to Reuters. Path Trading Partners Co-Founder and Chief Market Strategist Bob Iaccino joins Catalysts to detail how Fed interest rate cuts and asset inflation could fuel a jump in gold futures (GC=F). Gartner Vice President and Team Manager of Automotives, Transportation, and Cross Manufacturing Mike Ramsey also sits down to explain the future of Tesla's (TSLA) Supercharger network and the EV maker's plans for its full self-driving autonomous vehicles down the line. Other notable guests this hour include Santander US CEO Tim Wennes (SAN) and Gen Digital CEO Vincent Pilette (GEN).

"Just to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year," Musk said in a post on his social media platform X.  After the layoffs last week, Musk said Tesla planned to expand the Supercharger network but at a slower pace for new locations.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Elon Musk backtracks on Supercharger network halt, says more chargers coming</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-05-10 17:09:47+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>In a tweet on X early Friday morning, Musk addressed concerns many have had over his recent move to shrink down Tesla’s Supercharger team.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Making sense of Tesla's Supercharger, autonomous strategies</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-05-10 17:04:48+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has big plans to expand the EV maker's Supercharger network by investing over $500 million into the project, according to a recent post on X. The irony lies in the fact that Tesla laid off a bulk of its Supercharger development team at the end of April. Gartner Vice President and Team Manager of Automotives, Transportation, and Cross Manufacturing Mike Ramsey sits down with Catalysts to discuss Tesla's charging network strategy, calling the layoffs a "cost optimization effort as they try to get their operations in line" "But, the investment in the network actually makes a lot of sense, and might be a real benefit to them in the long term as a new source of revenue," Ramsey tells Yahoo Finance. Ramsey goes on to comment on Tesla's full self-driving capabilities in its vehicles; Tesla's Autopilot function is currently undergoing a probe by Department of Justice (DOJ) officials. "What they're charging customers for is a partially automated system that is more like a convenience feature. It is not a self-driving vehicle, like something that Waymo is offering in the southeast United States and in San Francisco," Ramsey states. "So when Tesla talks about this service improving and rolling out, they are not really playing in the same field as many of the, I would say, fully autonomous robocab-type providers are playing. That said, their system keeps getting better and better and they can make money selling it because it's a nice feature and that people like to have, and... Tesla has promised that in August they're going to unveil their new robocab that can... essentially be a full self-driving vehicle. My expectation is that vehicle will not be the same thing that you and I can buy..." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

She highlights the company's robust ad business and accelerating cloud operations, noting little to no weakness in it's online shopping segment. Tengler expresses confidence in leadership, stating, "We think Andy Jassy is one of the better operators in corporate America, so we're willing to give him the benefit of the doubt." Oracle (ORCL) also makes Tengler's list, with her describing the stock as being in "the sweet spot" of cloud software provision. She emphasizes Oracle's ability to offer solutions "in a way that's compatible with all the other providers." Tengler also praises the company's management team, characterizing Oracle as a great stock that's "not terribly expensive." Lastly, Tengler discusses her recent addition of AMD (AMD) to her portfolio.

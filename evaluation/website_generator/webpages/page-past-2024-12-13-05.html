"I think you're going to see all three businesses firing on all cylinders into 2025, and really for the first time since the pandemic," he states. Devitt highlights the resurgence in Amazon's retail segment growth, the continued success of AWS, and notes that while the stock has outperformed in 2024, he expects this momentum to build further into 2025. Regarding the competitive landscape, Devitt emphasizes Amazon's accelerating growth trajectory. He explains that customers had previously reduced spending "because the economy was weak," but with economic recovery underway and "the narrative corrected again," the company "sits in a very strong position." While highlighting Amazon's strengths, Devitt also points to Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) as major players in the space, describing all three tech giants as "net winners."

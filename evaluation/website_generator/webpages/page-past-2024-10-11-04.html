Here's why.</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-10-11 22:15:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Uber (UBER) shares ticked higher on Friday after Tesla's (TSLA) robotaxi event left investors largely disappointed. GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager Thomas Martin joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the competition between the two and why Uber benefitted from the event. "Both Tesla stock and Uber reacted the way you would have expected given the robo-day from Tesla. It was a classic example of long-term versus short-term. And they were the opposite for Uber and for Tesla," Martin says of the movement. He tells Yahoo Finance that "if Tesla was able to solve automated vehicles and robo in the near term or you saw a roadmap for even the intermediate term, then that was a problem potentially for Uber longer term. But the devil is in the details." As investors were left looking for more insight and further information about the robotaxi rollout, Uber became more attractive to investors. If Tesla cannot meet expected timelines for the release of its robotaxis, Uber will, therefore, have more time to get ahead of the game.

Here's why.</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-10-11 22:09:33+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>On today's installment of Good Buy or Goodbye, host Julie Hyman is joined by BD8 Capital Partners, LLC, CEO and CIO Barbara Doran to discuss her investment outlook in the rideshare space.  Doran recommends Uber (UBER) as a stock to buy, emphasizing its dominant market position and diversified business model. She notes, "they are just growing their share," currently at 76%, with its closest competitor, Lyft (LYFT), at just 23% of the rideshare market. Furthermore, Doran points out that Tesla's (TSLA) Cybercab unveil at its Robotaxi Day event suggests competition for autonomous driving isn't an imminent threat, as it will be "hard for them to catch up." She also highlights Uber's strong financial position, citing profitability, free cash flow of $1.7 billion, and a $7 billion share buyback authorization. The primary risk she identifies is a potential slowdown in consumer spending. On the other hand, Doran advises avoiding Lyft stock. She notes the company's lower profitability and significantly smaller scale compared to Uber, stating it's "going to be very tough" for Lyft to achieve Uber's current market status. Additionally, she points out Lyft's high debt-to-equity ratio, resulting in a weak balance sheet. Lyft stock also consistently underperforms its main competitor, Uber. However, Doran acknowledges one positive aspect: Lyft's new management team, which could drive continued improvement.

This has sent other rideshare stocks like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) higher on Friday. Roth MKM managing director Rohit Kulkarni joins Catalysts to discuss the rideshare sector. Kulkarni notes that the anticipation for Tesla's event was "an overhang" on Uber and Lyft stocks. He explains that the main investor question has been: If Tesla emerges as the preferred rideshare option, what happens to Uber and Lyft? This concern has grown "louder and louder over the last 3-6 months." However, based on the outcome of Thursday's robotaxi event, Kulkarni says it was "a big, big relief" for these companies because the event demonstrated that "creating a scalable robotaxi business is not easy." He notes it will take extensive time and resources, while Uber and Lyft continue to gain market share. "Tesla as a big, big player or potential big player is now off the table. That's the relief rally that you're seeing in Uber and Lyft," he states, adding that the next significant catalyst for these companies would likely come from advertising and subscription growth.

But that enthusiasm — propelled by CEO Elon Musk’s many promises — has made Tesla a victim of its own hype.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Tesla is a 'high-growth stock' that has 'hit a wall': Analyst</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-10-11 17:30:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Tesla's (TSLA) long-awaited robotaxi event largely disappointed investors who were left wanting more details. CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson joins Morning Brief to discuss how the event is weighing on Tesla's stock and whether CEO Elon Musk can deliver value to shareholders. Nelson believes that the decline in Tesla's stock could be the beginning of a larger pullback. "If you look at where it's trading on consensus estimates, the stock where it closed yesterday is trading at 75 times consensus estimates for next year. Looking out to 2026, it's trading at 57 times. So these are really pretty lofty multiples. And here we're left with a lot of questions regarding how it's going to achieve that earnings growth that is embedded in expectations over the next few years," he tells Yahoo Finance. He adds, "This is a high-growth stock whose growth has hit a wall here recently." Nelson points out that Elon Musk has a history of not meeting previously communicated timelines: "If you look back a decade ago, he was promising fully autonomous vehicles only a year or two away. Here we are in 2024, and it's still that. We think Tesla is still a ways away from that." Thus, he believes that the investors' expectations are "too high," especially given a general slowing of EV sales. With such a lack of clarity around Tesla's product pipeline, Nelson argues that auto names like General Motors (GM) and Uber (UBER) are among the best positioned to win when Tesla loses.

Katy Kaminski, AlphaSimplex chief research strategist and portfolio manager, joins Wealth! to discuss how investors can best navigate the EV trade. "I think the EV trade is a tricky one. It's exciting because anytime you have a disrupter of that type that is going to go in and potentially disrupt a business model that exists already, there's a lot of uncertainty about that type of event," Kaminski tells Yahoo Finance. She notes that there was a sell-off in Tesla's stock after the event, while names like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) were up. She explains, "What I would think that means is that this is an exciting idea. We need to watch it. But we also have a lot of things have to be figured out for this to come to fruition. So I think it's really a trade you'll have to watch and actually see ... how can they navigate the regulation front, how can they handle some of those issues that disrupting this industry would require." While the EV market has been under pressure, Kaminski highlights that inflation has been weighing on consumers, and many have put their plans to purchase cars on hold. She argues that Tesla's robotaxis could benefit from this environment, saying, "If vehicles continue to be more expensive, people are going to have to find alternatives. And that's where this could be a good trade." To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.

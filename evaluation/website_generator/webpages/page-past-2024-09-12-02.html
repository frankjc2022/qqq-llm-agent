Nvidia's (NVDA) latest earnings highlighted a major issue for the AI trade; despite beating earnings expectations, investors were disappointed as they looked for significant returns on massive capital expenditures (CapEx). RBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst Brad Erickson explains that investors are in a position where they have to put "blind faith" into AI players, knowing that it will pay off in the future. He tells Yahoo Finance, "From my perspective, like we're taking a little bit more of a measured approach, saying, 'Look, $200 billion. Think about what you need to do to maintain operating margins.' Pretty simple math of, like, are we really talking about $300, $400 billion of marginal revenue every single year? Those are big numbers." Microsoft (MSFT) is cutting about 650 employees from its Xbox gaming unit, the latest move in a string of layoffs that have impacted the video game industry. Wedbush Securities Managing Director, Equity Research Michael Pachter points out that in Microsoft's case, these jobs are redundant, stemming from its acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. As for the broader industry, he said hiring increased during the pandemic when people were at home playing video games. Now, these companies are "right-sizing," though Pachter thinks they may be cutting too many jobs. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the biggest takeaways from Thursday's trading session. Meanwhile, Market Domination anchor Julie Hyman reviews data from the Federal Reserve Bank of America which found home ownership affordability sentiments to have fallen to an 18-year low, equal to levels last seen in 2006. Finally, Josh Lipton covers some of the biggest after-hours movers, from Adobe (ADBE) to RH (RH).

As for the broader industry, he said hiring increased during the pandemic when people were at home playing video games. Now, these companies are "right-sizing," though Pachter thinks they may be cutting too many jobs. Pachter also points to a broader shift in the industry, away from one where people buy the game once at a high price to one where there are in-game purchases. As a result, game makers don't need to make as many games to gain revenue and customers are playing existing titles for longer. Watch the video above to hear what Pachter thinks of Sony's (SONY) new PlayStation 5 Pro and why Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) "has a lot of momentum."

RBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst Brad Erickson joins Asking for a Trend to break down the state of the AI trade and the technology's outlook amid a heated competition. Erickson explains that generative AI platforms are emerging "right in front of us," pointing to software engineering efficiencies, customer support platforms, and marketing tools as examples. He also highlights sovereign AI, where countries are spending on the technology to use and access data that no one else has. He adds, "If you look at like the top four or five CapEx spenders on AI infrastructure, it's $200 billion and it's going up next year probably by more than 10%." He explains that investors are in a position where they have to put "blind faith" into AI players, knowing that it will pay off in the future. He tells Yahoo Finance, "From my perspective, like we're taking a little bit more of a measured approach, saying, 'Look, $200 billion. Think about what you need to do to maintain operating margins.' Pretty simple math of, like, are we really talking about $300, $400 billion of marginal revenue every single year? Those are big numbers." Erickson believes that competing AI tools from names like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and OpenAI will ultimately "end up looking a lot of the same kind of thing." He argues that distribution is a more important factor and will likely determine the level of success.

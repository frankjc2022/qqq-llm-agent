It has now it has been revealed in an interview with Qualcomm's CEO that the companies are collaborating on new mixed-reality glasses. TechRadar Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff joins Market Domination to discuss this development. Ulanoff observes that the market for mixed reality headsets has proven to be "a struggle" for many companies. He references Apple's (AAPL) Vision Pro, noting that while the product is "incredible," it likely hasn't sold the way Apple would have liked. Ulanoff points out that Qualcomm-Google's focus on smart glasses rather than a headset could potentially yield better results. As far as features, Ulanoff notes to capture consumer attention the glasses have to have two key things. First they have to be "excellent looking," and secondly the display technology must allow for an "overlaying of the world in front of you."

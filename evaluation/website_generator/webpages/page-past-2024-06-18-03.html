The law, which took effect in 2022, “requires warehouse employers to provide employees written notice of any quotas they must follow, including the number of tasks they need to perform per hour and any discipline that could come” from not meeting the requirements, the labor commissioner's office said in a statement.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Disney CEO Bob Iger's successor could be revealed in 2024, says his close adviser</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-06-18 20:10:11+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Disney CEO Bob Iger and the company's board continue to work through finding his successor.

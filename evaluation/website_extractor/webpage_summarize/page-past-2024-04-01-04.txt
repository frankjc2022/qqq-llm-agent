Tesla has faced challenges, with BYD surpassing it in quarterly sales for the first time, while Tesla's stock performance has been disappointing. Analysts predict a significant decline in Tesla's first-quarter deliveries, with expectations that numbers may fall below those of the previous year. Despite Tesla's increased spending on advertising, investor sentiment is waning, and there are concerns about the lack of near-term catalysts for growth.

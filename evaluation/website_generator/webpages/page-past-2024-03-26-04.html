Following its market debut, Reddit (RDDT) outperformed expectations after positioning itself as an AI play. Bedrock Founder & Managing Partner Geoff Lewis joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into how AI is disrupting various sectors in the market. Lewis focuses particularly on OpenAI and its possible future maneuvers. He compares the company's current legal situation to the "early days of Facebook" (META): "Facebook had a lot of lawsuits as well. I say bring on the lawsuits with respect to OpenAI. I think that's a strong bull signal. The reality is this is a company that's really only been monetizing for just over a year, predominantly with consumers. They've only recently launched offerings to enterprises. It's been publicly reported they're north of a $2 billion revenue run rate. I don't think we've ever seen either in the private markets a revenue ramp that's been this rapid."

The board, which is funded by Meta but operates independently, said the social media giant should remove posts containing the word "shaheed" only when they are linked to clear signs of violence or if they separately break other Meta rules.  The ruling comes after years of criticism of the company's handling of content involving the Middle East, including in a 2021 study Meta itself commissioned that found its approach had an "adverse human rights impact" on Palestinians and other Arabic-speaking users of its services.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Florida Law Bans Social Media for Minors Under 14</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-03-26 13:16:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Florida Gov.

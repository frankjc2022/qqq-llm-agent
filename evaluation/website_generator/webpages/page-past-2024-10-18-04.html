Daymond John, FUBU and the Shark Group founder, and Brandon Sawalich, Starkey CEO, discuss how Starkey is using AI to revolutionize the hearing aid industry. John explains that he uses Starkey hearing aids, and explains, "they're way more than something that I just use to amplify hearing, which is probably the most important part. But now I can use them for so much more." Sawalich explains that Starkey is "redefining hearing aids and eliminating the stigma of what hearing aids is." He continues, "It's not about amplifying sound. You have a mini computer inside your ear where basically the ear is the new wrist, and helping people be the best selves they can be each and every day." The technology can be used for things like listening to music, sending messages, and translating languages. Sawalich even calls it "your personal assistant." Women's sports have captured investors’ attention as WNBA viewership soars to a record high amid the WNBA Finals. Fortuna Investments CEO Justus Parmar breaks down why the venture capital firm is investing in women’s sports. Parmar outlines his view that sports is an emerging investment area with women’s sport representing an especially attractive investment opportunity. “It's a very unique asset class. So you've got the big four men's clubs. Those are kind of the blue-chip stocks of the portfolio. You've got men's baseball, men's basketball, men's football, obviously, and NHL hockey… When it comes to women's sports, it's much like a, I don't want to say a venture or a growth investment, but you know, some people think it's underrepresented.” Finally, Josh Lipton breaks down what to watch next week, from Tesla (TSLA) earnings to fresh housing data.

Wedbush Securities managing director and senior equity analyst Dan Ives joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination and why he holds steadfast in his bullish view of Tesla. "I came away, in 25 years covering tech, I think (it was) one of the most eye-popping historical events I've ever attended,” Ives tells Yahoo Finance. He says while there was criticism about the event and concerns that the tech is not as advanced as Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggests, Ives says bears said the same thing about iPhone 16, which the analyst expects to fuel a super cycle for Apple (AAPL). “A lot of analysts, if it's not spoon-fed to you, they're bearish. They don't understand. The point is if I look at Cybercab, the autonomous future where this is all going, I mean, I think this is going to really be the start of a whole new company at Tesla.” He says, “I get the lack of details and why people walk away wanting more, but I look, I just have a different take in terms of my view of where things are heading. And I think the way so many analysts have missed a lot of these stocks, going from $1 trillion to $2 trillion to $3 trillion… is that they can find the technology in their spreadsheets on the tenth floor of their New York City office building.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

"I think we're still in the early innings for Nvidia. Nvidia clearly is capturing the bulk of the value capture in the sector and industry," Ahluwalia tells Yahoo Finance. He expects Nvidia stock to hit $150 by the end of 2024, especially as hyperscalers intend to spend between $50-$100 billion on GPU compute. Ahluwalia believes "there's no question" about Nvidia being the first company to reach a $4 trillion valuation. He argues, "We made a call earlier this year that Nvidia would be the most valuable company in the world. It achieved that milestone yesterday, and the demand for GPU chips is strong. And you're seeing enterprises start to get some ROI (return on investment) on it from the early adopters — Meta's (META) seen ROI on their CapEx (capital expenditures) spend. So, we think Nvidia's got plenty of room to grow from here." Of the "Magnificent Seven" players, he sees Nvidia as the AI winner alongside Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta.

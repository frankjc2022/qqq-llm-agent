Moor Insights & Strategy Founder and CEO Patrick Moorhead joins Market Domination to give insight into the announcement from OpenAI and its potential deal with Apple. Moorhead outlines why this announcement was important for OpenAI despite lagging evidence about the impact of AI adoption: "Technology is always slower to be adopted than we all think it's going to. In Silicon Valley, it comes overnight. But the reality is to hit typical consumers and even businesses come years after use. But you have to show off the latest and greatest to get people excited. It's kind of like the beginning of an investment bubble, right? Let's get everybody excited.

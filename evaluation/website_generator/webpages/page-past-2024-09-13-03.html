Analyst explains why.</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-09-13 15:42:08+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Shares of Oracle (ORCL) are rising after the company lifted its fiscal 2026 forecast and announced that it expects sales during fiscal 2029 to cross $104 billion. Wolfe Research managing director and head of software research Alex Zukin joins Morning Brief to break down the company's position in the overall AI race. "Oracle is advantaged. I think Oracle is really good at building enterprise-class infrastructure. I think they've been doing it for decades. On the software side, I think the Oracle database supports some of the most mission-critical hardened workloads in the world. I think that over time, both the database and the application portfolio customers are going to have to migrate, at least probably the majority of those workloads, over to the cloud to take advantage of some of these innovations that we've been speaking about around generative AI," he tells Yahoo Finance. He adds that the company has built an ecosystem with other hyperscalers that allows customers to easily move their workloads to the cloud, and points to its partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an example. He explains that Oracle has "a lot of irons in the fire across the entire ecosystem," which it is able to translate into accelerating growth and improving profitability.

One of the chip giant's competitors, AMD (AMD), has just partnered with Microsoft (MSFT) to offer its products to Microsoft's cloud computing customers. Wedbush Equity Research SVP Matt Bryson and Truist Securities Managing Director William Stein join Market Domination to give insight into what investors should expect from Nvidia's earnings, how AMD stands in the sector, and how investors should navigate the chip sectors. Stein argues that Nvidia's short-term future is most likely successful, but uncertainty mounts down the line: "I think certainly they're going to beat this quarter. And I think they're going to beat in the out quarter guide as well. But I think the real question is what happens through this year and into next year's numbers. Does the company give us an indication that we're going to continue to see growth and very strong demand, both for units and for integrated systems, where the company is getting the growth from?"

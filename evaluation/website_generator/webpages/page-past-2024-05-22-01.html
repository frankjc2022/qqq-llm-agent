Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist Lou Basenese joins Asking for a Trend to break down the earnings and analyze how long the company can keep up the momentum. Despite beating Wall Street's expectations, Basenese highlights that the magnitude of Nvidia's beat is the smallest it has ever been, at about 8%. He warns, "Expectations at some point are going to get too far ahead of what Nvidia can deliver, but it's not yet." "I think it's the leading candidate to be the next $3 trillion market cap company, but if I had a dollar to put to work today and I want to 10x it, it's not Nvidia. It's probably in the smaller cap side of the market," he adds, saying that of the "Magnificent Seven," Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is the most "reasonably valued." Basenese calls Nvidia's stock split a "brilliant move psychologically," as buying a stock at a lower price is more enticing. He adds that it does not change any of Nvidia's fundamental metrics or value calculations. For investors looking to get in on the AI sector, Basenese highlights Microsoft's (MSFT) ability to push AI products onto the market to create demand. He also points to Apple (AAPL) as "the sleeper AI play."  "Apple is kind of perceived as they missed the boat ... they're never first or second to market. They come in later, but then they go. They come in late, but they end up being the leader." He adds, "They have two billion active devices in use. If they just iterate and add a little AI somewhere, it has a magnified impact."

Schiller, who has been overseeing the iPhone app store since its inception in 2008, made the admission during occasionally sheepish testimony about the new payment options that so far have been shunned by all but a few dozen apps since their introduction in January.  “We have worked hard to create this program and I think we need to do a lot more to do to get developers,” Schiller said.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Tracking Jeremy Grantham's GMO Capital Portfolio - Q1 2024 Update</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-05-22 20:25:32+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Jeremy Grantham's 13F portfolio value surged to $27.52B as top holdings include Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, UnitedHealth, and Apple.

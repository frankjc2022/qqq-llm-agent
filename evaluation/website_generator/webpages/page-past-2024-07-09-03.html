Now Amazon (AMZN) wants to own the chips that power its cloud and boost profits by gaining share in the chips market, currently led by Nvidia (NVDA). Yahoo Finance got an exclusive first look at AWS’s latest chip, called the Graviton4. What makes this latest chip special? It’s the most powerful and efficient AWS chip to date. It’s 35% faster than the prior generation and has 75% more memory bandwidth. It’s the latest example of the research and development tech firms are willing to pour into chip development. AI is fueling demand for semiconductors - the guts that power the AI boom - meaning companies have to build those guts at a record-breaking pace. Whoever does it the fastest stands to grab up chip juggernaut Nvidia's market share - currently 80% of the GPU chips market. That’s fueling a race between tech and chips companies, not only fueled by competition but also propelled by government incentives designed to fight back against China and have the United States retake the lead as the world’s dominant global chip manufacturer. Can AWS get a larger slice of the chips market pie? Here’s what’s next in the chips race. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT in the business of neurotechnology. In this series, Yahoo Finance will feature stories that give a glimpse at the future, and show how companies are making big moves today that will matter tomorrow.

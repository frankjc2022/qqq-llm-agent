Rasgon explains that Broadcom has several different business segments, from semiconductors and software to infrastructure. "They also have what I would call the second-best AI story in the space I think after Nvidia," he adds. He breaks down how Broadcom partners with tech giants like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META), who are making and scaling their own chips. He adds, "[AI] networking, frankly, is just as important as the compute. And they're the 800-pound gorilla there." He explains that Broadcom's current guidance for its AI revenues this year is more than $10 billion, about a third of its overall semiconductor business.

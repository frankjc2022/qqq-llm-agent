Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Deleveska joins Asking for a Trend to break down the chip company's earnings expectations and how the market might react. "We're pretty confident that the company will beat expectations, however, what we've been seeing this quarter specifically is that companies beat and raise, but the market, no matter what they report, finds it pretty disappointing. So it wouldn't be surprising to see that to be the scenario," Deleveska says. She adds that the upside for Nvidia will come in the next two years as more data centers begin to pop up and that its chips are "positioned very well both for training and inference." Deleveska explains that as the AI race heats up, there are unique opportunities for companies that provide thermal management: "These are really big, massive areas of investment that are going to benefit equally from the data center investment cycle."

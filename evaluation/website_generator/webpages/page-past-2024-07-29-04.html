Meta is up first, with many investors concerned about how much advertisers are spending on its platforms. RBC Capital Markets internet analyst Brad Erickson joins Market Domination to give insight into Meta's upcoming earnings and what investors should know about its performance in the advertising space, while also briefly touching on Amazon. "We think Meta is actually going to guide just fine. We know there's a lot of concern. We know there's a lot of smoke out there in the macro, but we do think fundamental results are going to be there. Now, the kicker on Meta is how is Mark Zuckerberg going to sound on capex, the metaverse, AI, and return on investment timeline very, very hard to predict. But fundamentally, I think we're feeling actually quite good on Meta heading into the print." Watch the video above to hear which stock Erickson prefers: Amazon or Meta?

Investors are keenly watching to see how AI spending will impact company revenues. Neuberger Berman senior research Analyst Daniel Flax joins Market Domination to discuss his outlook. Flax believes that upcoming tech earnings will highlight "the buildout of the cloud infrastructure" and AI. With Amazon and Microsoft earnings on the horizon, he notes, "I expect they'll see strong growth" within Azure and Amazon Web Services. He points out that the cloud businesses among tech giants are generating substantial revenues, arguing that "this need to invest, I think, is the right strategy," despite acknowledging that revenue generation from AI specifically will take time. "I do think the investments or the capital expenditures are a necessary part of it. I expect you'll see incremental revenues from these newer areas over the next 12-24 months. The key though... these are very healthy businesses for these companies," Flax told Yahoo Finance.

Investors will be watching the results closely following some mixed results from Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL). Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager Bryant VanCronkhite joins Wealth! to give insight into the upcoming tech earnings from Big Tech names and what investors should keep in mind moving forward. VanCronkhite explains that though the AI trade has fueled the market gains, right now, the developments aren't really showing up in quarterly results, leaving some investors questioning when it will happen. In terms of the tech sector, and the rotation into small caps that has been seen in markets the last few weeks, VanCronkhite states: "I've been calling for this value rotation going back a couple of weeks now, and it's starting to play out well. There could be more legs to this, and it makes a lot of sense. With the amount of money being concentrated in a narrow market, we only get there for one of two reasons. We either get there because of greed or exuberance, which we have today around the AI trade, or you get there out of fear. When you're worried about the overall economy, maybe the Fed being late to react, pushing us into a recession, you want to get more and more capital around a fewer and fewer set of companies where you have the most visibility." He continues with: "So both fear and greed have pushed capital into a narrow market, but those will both get resolved eventually. And I think that the cool inflation prints is giving the market the belief the Fed can begin to act, giving them the chance to jump through that ever closing window to avoid a recession. And as that happens, the natural rotation is out of the concentrate names into the value trade into the broader markets."

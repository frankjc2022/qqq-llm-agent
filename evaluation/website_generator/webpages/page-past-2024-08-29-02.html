Investors may be trying to understand where this slide comes from despite all the hype around AI. Tusk Venture Partners Founder And CEO Bradley Tusk joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into Nvidia's earnings, the AI sector, and the potential for OpenAI's next round of funding. In terms of why Nvidia shares have been sliding, despite a positive Q2 performance, Tusk says: "Really it's sort of I think speaks to a slightly broader concern, which is at the back of investors minds. They're starting to wonder like, 'hey, are we over inflating this? Is it going too far?' Because they couldn't have really done any better than they did. It's unreasonable. Like 'it's your fault.' It's not their fault. It's a question of are they overvalued and that's collectively our fault, right? " With the Wall Street Journal reporting that Nvidia is in talks about investing in OpenAI, Tusk comments: "What's the strategic value for you in having a role with OpenAI? What they all might say is, look, we want a seat at the table. 'We want to know what they're up to. We don't want all of a sudden, Microsoft taking this thing going off in a totally different direction, that we can't compete with.'"

Investigators from the Washington State Patrol made the discovery after downloading information from the event-data recorder on the 2022 Tesla Model S, agency spokesman Capt. Deion Glover said Tuesday.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week that “Full Self Driving” should be able to run without human supervision by the end of this year.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Police say Tesla involved in an April crash that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle was operating on self-driving system</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-30 22:35:29+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Police say Tesla involved in an April crash that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle was operating on self-driving system.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>AI is at an 'important inflection' point: Futurum Group CEO</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-30 20:47:11+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>This week brings a wave of earnings reports across various industries, with many investors focusing on AI spending, especially within Big Tech. The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman joins Market Domination to share his perspective. Newman describes the AI trend as "a blockbuster moment." He emphasizes that companies must invest heavily in AI for research, infrastructure, and more, warning that "they are going to get it wrong" if they don't. He stresses the importance of companies not underinvesting and missing "this trend line." However, Newman acknowledges there will be "a digestion period" before the benefits of these investments materialize. "We're at this really important inflection," Newman tells Yahoo Finance. "We're at this point where people are still a little uncertain what it means. You have all these knowledge workers where work is being done for them. They're a little uncertain what it means for their future, for their jobs." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

The problem stems from a software flaw that may fail to detect when the hood is unlatched. Additionally, Stellantis (STLA) is looking to impose cost-cutting measures, offering buyouts to US salaried workers.

Rockland Trust chief investment officer David Smith joins Catalysts to share his outlook on tech stocks. Smith notes, "It's a data-intensive point in the season," with earnings reports and Federal Reserve decisions all scheduled for this week. However, following lackluster reports from companies like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) last week, Smith observes that "there's very little appetite for companies that miss earnings," especially in the technology sector, which explains the massive sell-offs markets have seen. Regarding AI investments by Big Tech companies, Smith explains to Yahoo Finance, "I think... AI is important to all of the Magnificent 7 in different ways, so to paint them all with the same brush is a little bit risky."

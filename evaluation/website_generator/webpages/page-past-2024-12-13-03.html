"I think you're going to see all three businesses firing on all cylinders into 2025, and really for the first time since the pandemic," he states. Devitt highlights the resurgence in Amazon's retail segment growth, the continued success of AWS, and notes that while the stock has outperformed in 2024, he expects this momentum to build further into 2025. Regarding the competitive landscape, Devitt emphasizes Amazon's accelerating growth trajectory. He explains that customers had previously reduced spending "because the economy was weak," but with economic recovery underway and "the narrative corrected again," the company "sits in a very strong position." While highlighting Amazon's strengths, Devitt also points to Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) as major players in the space, describing all three tech giants as "net winners."

D-Wave (QBTS), a quantum computing company, announced it secured $175 million in funding. CEO Alan Baratz joins Catalysts Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to break down what's going on in the quantum computing space and what investors need to know about its connection to artificial intelligence (AI). "There's a lot of synergy between AI and quantum," Baratz says, adding, "The way I think about it is that there are three areas in which AI and quantum work together." "The first and most obvious is that each can work side by side to solve a problem synergistically. For example, you might use AI to predict product demand in the future and then use quantum computing to optimize the supply chain to meet that demand." "Second, we are doing a fair amount of work right now on how quantum computing could be used as part of the model training and inference for AI." The CEO explains, "Because of the fact that [quantum is] so much faster than classical [computing] and requires so much less power, we think that we may be able to support model training and inference with much lower power consumption than what's happening today, which could be a game-changer." "Finally, models on quantum distributions rather than classical distributions may allow for more accurate [AI] models."

"We see our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive," Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in the call with investors Thursday evening. Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler joins Market Domination's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to speak more about Broadcom's forecast and its stock's new record high: "At this point, you still want to own the stock and there probably will be a pull back after this big surge, and then you'll get another chance if you don't own it to own it. But I think this is a stock you want to own for the long term. They raise the dividend 11%, which is which is below historical growth rates of 15%. But they're using the free cash flow to pay down the debt on VMware." Bernstein Managing Director and Senior Analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance earlier today that Broadcom's incredibly upbeat forecast on AI demand is giving investors "a reason to dream" again.

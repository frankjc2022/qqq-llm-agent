Pernas Research Co-Founder Deiya Pernas and Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney join Market Domination to discuss the state of index investing. Pernas believes investors' biggest worry should be "complacency" in the indexes. "The market's trading at 21 times forward. and it's somewhat typical of late-cycle that you see large cap quality do quite well and that's what we've seen this year," Pernas elaborates, pointing out small cap equities' value growth is flat and may not be participating in market rallies.

"Tere's a lot of examples this earnings season, especially in technology, so we don't need to be near airlines and autos or retailers or some of these other ones that are mentioned. We don't need to be in those industries," Mahoney explains, later going on to discuss big names in tech. "We're in the fast lane, we're growth managers.

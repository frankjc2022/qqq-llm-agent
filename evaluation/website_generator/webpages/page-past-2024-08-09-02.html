    <div class='news-section'><h2>News on stock symbol NVDA</h2><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Streaming wars, tech sector rebound: Asking for a Trend</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-08-09 22:04:51+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>On today's episode of Asking for a Trend, Host Josh Lipton breaks down some of the top trends and takeaways from the trading week. Streaming giants Disney (DIS) and Paramount (PARA, PARAA) both reported earnings this week. Disney reported an earnings beat on both the top and bottom lines for its fiscal third quarter, revealing its streaming segment was profitable for the first time. Paramount Global reported mixed results for its second quarter, with adjusted earnings beating estimates, but revenue falling short of expectations. Morningstar Senior Equity Analyst Matthew Dolgin explains, "All these companies other than Netflix (NFLX) are continuing to make progress, but they are just not there, not mature." He adds, "the difference with them and Netflix, a decade or less ago, is that they have these other legacy businesses that they're managing. And so they're not getting the pass from Wall Street as streaming continues to grow and is not yet a mature or good business necessarily. They're seeing their other business decline, so they need that to turn." Despite a volatile week on Wall Street, investors still seem to love tech. Semiconductor stocks closed largely in the green, despite Nvidia (NVDA) falling 2.3%. Meanwhile, bond yields are bouncing back after coming under pressure last week. Jared Blikre breaks down his biggest takeaways from the trading week. The phrase "bad news is good news" for stocks used to be true, but now good economic news is good news for stocks. Josh Schafer breaks down a chart from Piper Sandler's Michael Kantrowitz taking a look at the impact of economic news on stocks ahead of big economic news out next week, including the CPI report and retail sales. Anduril Industries, a defense tech start-up, raised $1.5 billion, making the company valued at $14 billion, co-led by Founders Fund, which is Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, and Sands Capital. Anduril now joins a small, elite group of high-valued defense companies like Lockheed Martin (LMT). The company's goal is "to manufacture and produce tens of thousands of autonomous weapons systems addressing the urgent needs of the United States and our allies," according to a company press release. Venrock Partner Nick Beim explains, "I think there's a boom in the global defense industry generally. We've got wars in Europe and the Middle East. China has adopted a very aggressive military posture toward Taiwan and is trying to leapfrog US military capabilities by investing in tech. And so broadly, the defense industry is booming."

Laffer Tengler Investments CEO & CIO Nancy Tengler joins Yahoo Finance to discuss recent market volatility. "This was a great opportunity to add to some high-quality names and in addition, we get a correction one way or another every 12 months and so this was long overdue," Tengler says. "I'm not sure it's over by the way," Tengler adds. However, she thinks that stocks will recover due to the influence of generative AI on the economy.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are reversing some of the gains made in Thursday's trading session as volatility rocks the market. Edward Jones senior investment strategist Mona Mahajan explains, "Markets have certainly calmed much more meaningfully over the last couple of days than we saw Monday and Tuesday of this week even... We've seen this week alone the jobless claim figures that came in below expectations provided a little comfort to the market that is really looking for direction on a couple of things. One, is the US labor market headed towards some sort of meaningful collapse or downside, and two, is the broader economy headed towards a downturn as well? And I think for us, both of the answers to both of those questions are no." The tech sector has been particularly rocked by market volatility this week, yet Goldman Sachs Asset Management fundamental equity managing director Luke Barrs still sees opportunity. "Selectively, there's great opportunity across the broad market, but specifically in tech as well. There are some transformational themes that are coming through that are driving earnings," he explains. He adds, "When we come to technology, what is very apparent is not just the macroeconomic picture, but also the fact that people want to see... evidence that that gen AI trade is actually driving positive outcomes." A global market sell-off occurred on Monday after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates, which unwinded the yen carry trade (JPY=X). TD Securities global head of FX and EM strategy Mark McCormick believes that the carry trade unwind isn't over, explaining, "The structural nature of the carry trade is that for pretty much around the last decade, Japanese investors have put their money, mostly pension funds, which accounts for about 80% of GDP in other markets. So the assets that they're tracking in other markets are actually a big form of the carry trade." Some retail investors used the market sell-off as a buying opportunity. IG Group North America CEO JJ Kinahan notes, "Every crisis... we've had over the last five years, where retail traders tend to start are two technology names, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT)." He adds that "Apple and Microsoft are going to be names that retail trades significantly anyways, but made up a larger percentage of trading on Monday and Tuesday, for sure, as people were looking for places to go buy."

Arctic Wolf has released its new Human Risk Report today, which analyzes some of the top cybersecurity risks facing companies. Nick Schneider, Arctic Wolf president and CEO, calls the election "an event that sparks a lot of interest from bad actors." He explains, "I think during an election year or any time there's an event that has significant interest in the public sphere, you're going to get increased interest and increased activity from the bad actors, both against businesses, but also against individuals, and kind of where those two meet or intersect is also additional risk to individual organizations." BJ Schaknowski, CEO of symplr, discusses the state of the healthcare industry as AI becomes increasingly adopted. Schaknowski explains that symplr is helping hospitals become more productive by helping with tasks associated with compliance, quality, and safety. He notes these tasks have been "wildly fragmented" in hospitals, working "against the productivity of critical healthcare workers who should be providing care, not sitting in front of a laptop, inputting data." Schaknowski notes that nurses spend about three to five hours a day in front of a computer screen when they instead can be focused on mentoring newer nurses and spending more time caring for patients. Yahoo Finance Data and Markets Editor Jared Blikre breaks down some of his biggest takeaways from the trading day as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed at a record high and the volatility index (^VIX) is down just below 20.

Kairos Power CEO Mike Laufer joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime to discuss the company’s recent energy deal with Google and explain why tech giants are big on nuclear power. Laufer explains that the company plans to deliver small modular reactors to the tech giant by 2035. “What's significant about this agreement between Google and Kairos Power is it really lays the path to that long term commitment. It's the first corporate agreement for multiple reactor deployments, and that target of 500MW (megawatt) by 2035 is really it really builds on the iterative process that Kairos is employing to do our first technology demonstrations, where we're doing non-nuclear demonstrations” The CEO says these AI data centers "need for power... has kind of changed the dynamic [around nuclear energy] really in the last year to year and a half from where it was." He says Kairos Power’s “mission [is] to really fulfill the potential for nuclear and the role that it can play in decarbonization is central to the company. What's really important about this agreement is that Google is not just a customer, but they're really an important partner.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.

Tesla's (TSLA) highly anticipated robotaxi event is on Thursday, and Barron's associate editor Al Root points to five things investors are expecting from the highly anticipated event. First, there will be a physical unveiling of the robotaxi. Second, investors want to hear about safety data. Next, Tesla will likely touch on its business model, discussing everything from licensing to the size of its robotaxi fleet. The fourth point investors will be looking for is a launch date. Finally, Tesla could announce something extra. Root explains, "A lot of people think we'll see the lower price so-called Model 2 that's due in early 2025, maybe that will make an appearance. And maybe an update about the robot called Optimist." Stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) closed lower on Monday, retreating from Friday's gains that were fueled by September's better-than-expected jobs figures. Yahoo Finance senior markets reporter Josh Schafer analyzes the day's key market trends, focusing on the rise in 10-year Treasury yields (^TNX) and the noticeable slowdown in interest rate-sensitive stocks. The US dockworkers port strikes have temporarily paused, allowing for continued negotiations. University of Richmond's Robins School of Business professor Shital Thekdi notes that the core of the port strike dialogue centers on "efficiencies and the use of automation in ways that can replace workers." However, she emphasizes that other critical considerations are at play, including extreme events, "atypical working conditions," and "generally unsafe working conditions." "The potential is that AI and technology can actually help improve health and safety of workers, which is incredibly important," Thekdi tells Yahoo Finance. Is good economic news finally translating into good news for equities? Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman breaks down Citi's Economic Surprise Index and how positive data — in the form of inflation readings and labor market figures — could be pulling stocks higher along with it.

Root points to five things investors are expecting from the robotaxi event. First, there will be a physical unveiling of the robotaxi. Second, investors want to hear about safety data. Next, Tesla will likely touch on its business model, discussing everything from licensing to the size of its robotaxi fleet. The fourth point investors will be looking for is a launch date. Finally, Tesla could announce something extra. Root explains, "A lot of people think we'll see the lower price so-called Model 2 that's due in early 2025, maybe that will make an appearance. And maybe an update about the robot called Optimist." Root also compares Tesla and Waymo's self-driving vehicles. While Waymo has built driverless vehicles and took a modest approach to its rollout, Root notes that Tesla is instead focused on improving its driver-assistance software to turn vehicles into self-driving cars. "Now, Tesla argues, 'We've got millions of cars giving us data. We have billions of miles driven with full self-drive on.' Yet, they've never done a single official autonomous cab ride. Waymo has," Root tells Yahoo Finance. He continues, "So it's sort of like, you tell me, which approach do you like better? One feels a little safer. One feels a little more Musk-ian. And that's the way Tesla has gone." Watch the video above to find out what stocks could benefit from Tesla's robotaxi event.

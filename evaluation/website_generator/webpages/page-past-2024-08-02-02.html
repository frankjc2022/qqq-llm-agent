I think all this has done has proven that's not true." Bajarin thinks this is a sign that Intel's turnaround is going to take longer than many thought. Barjarin says that Intel has plans, but "a lot just's got to go right...there's a lot of things that have to play in their favor" for them all to be executed successfully making leadership key. Watch the video above to hear Bajarin's take on Apple's (AAPL) third quarter results and why the launch of generative AI efforts may be "rocky."

While acknowledging the immediate market impact of the Nvidia (NVDA) report, Wren predicts an eventual market broadening as economic momentum decelerates. He identifies a strategic opportunity in potential market pullbacks, highlighting sectors like financials, industrials, communication services, and energy as attractive investment targets. "Broader is better. It's pretty narrow right now, and I think these growth companies are going to continue to be the ones that drive the market," Wren explains. However, he cautions investors, stating, "It's not time to be overweight small-caps or overweight high yield.... We're still late cycle here in the markets."

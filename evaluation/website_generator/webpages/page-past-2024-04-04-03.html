It completes a $4 billion total investment the tech giant announced in the fall.  AWS Vice President of AI Products Matt Wood calls Anthropic's Claude 3 "the best performing generative AI model." He says Claude 3l is available to AWS customers, who can build on top of the model to build their needed AI functions.  Wood tells Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley he has never seen such excitement from customers over a new technology. "The opportunity for them is really to be able to just completely reimagine core elements of their business, core elements of their customer experience, and to design and deliver entirely new categories of products," Wood says, noting that there is a lot of enthusiasm from industries that tend to be more highly regulated.  Watch the video above to hear what Wood says the number one thing customers want from generative AI.

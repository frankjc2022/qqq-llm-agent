Kestra Investment Management CIO Kara Murphy and Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska join Market Domination to help investors navigate the bigger picture amid uncertain economic conditions. Murphy points out the strength in the market despite Fed expectations: "Economic growth has been stronger, corporate earnings have been stronger. What we're finding is that there's some really good fundamental underpinning for the strength in equities, so yes, it might be a bit of a disappointment that we don't get the Fed rate cuts, but the fact is the economy just doesn't need it." Delevska claims the market can reach new heights thanks to a shift to earnings: "We cover the technology sectors specifically, so we didn't like some of the more cyclical areas like semiconductors, you will see explosive growth, because earnings have really been under pressure, anywhere you look outside of AI. Then on the softer side, you're not going to see as being earning surprises, but those companies have really struggled to keep up their high-growth numbers. I think that is going to really change as we get into the second half." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

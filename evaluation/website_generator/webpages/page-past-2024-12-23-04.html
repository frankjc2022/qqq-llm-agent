Kenwell says retail investors are "optimistic" but "realistic" for the new year. "They're looking to gain more exposure to crypto in 2025. They're looking to gain more exposure to equities in 2025. But they're also looking to raise some cash here," he says, later adding: "I think they're being prudent, but also, you know, keeping one foot in at least is so they keep getting taking advantage of, you know, more gains to come in 2025 if that is the case." The analyst reports that the survey found retail investors to prefer the financials sector and big-cap tech, including Magnificent Seven names and other artificial intelligence (AI) plays.

"We think we're headed toward a period of rapid technological shifts. Historically, whenever that's happened, significant opportunities have been unlocked," Crowley explains. He believes AI's economic impact could rival that of the internet revolution. Crowley identifies "real-world AI" as the sector's next evolution, highlighting two key investment opportunities. First, he points to "entirely new product-category" companies like Tesla (TSLA), which is advancing autonomous driving technology. Second, he sees potential in established companies with "existing business lines," such as Amazon (AMZN), which can leverage AI to enhance operational efficiency. "We're kind of trying to move into the next phase here of where we see AI playing out," he tells Yahoo Finance.

His top pick for 2025 and large-cap stocks, in fact, is rideshare giant Uber Technologies (UBER). "When we looked at Uber we see a couple of things: Number one, an outsized risk reward. Our fair value is $96... with we believe not much downside. The stock also has gotten caught up in a lot of debates in the last few months... [including] the debate around Waymo and what will happen to autonomous vehicles over the next three, five, seven, ten years," Sheridan tells Catalyst hosts Seana Smith and Brian Sozzi. Sheridan also shares his favorable outlook on Magnificent Seven players Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META). “Amazon, among those three, probably has the most upside. We believe Amazon still has exposure to the widest collection of the secular themes you want exposure to in the digital economy,” Sheridan says. “Media consumption habits, shopping, cloud computing, AI — these are all themes you want a lot of exposure to."

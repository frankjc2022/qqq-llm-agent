Scott Devitt, Wedbush Securities managing director of equity research, appears on Market Domination to discuss Uber's new partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) and its role in the larger AV landscape. "Uber supports the autonomous industry by providing distribution," Devitt shares. "It's comforting to think that Uber may be well positioned when we get to fully autonomous, but that's probably the greatest risk to its business model as well." Devitt also discusses the dynamics between Waymo, Tesla (TSLA), and Uber and how these relationships may play out in the future.

VanCronkhite warns of investor "complacency" in 2025, particularly regarding the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. While acknowledging their "tremendous" returns, he cautions, "That's a risk because the market is broadening out right now." He explains, "We don't want to pay as much of a multiple for companies that are growing slower, which is the Mag Seven, compared to the broader market, which is the Russell 2000 (^RUT) and the Russell mid-cap stocks." VanCronkhite advises investors to be strategic. "That doesn't mean sell it; it doesn't mean leave. Just be careful about staying too long. Rotate down," he tells Yahoo Finance. Regarding sector opportunities, VanCronkhite expresses caution about the banking sector, describing it as "nerve-racking" despite market optimism. Instead, he points to materials and healthcare as sectors with attractive valuations that could outperform in 2025.

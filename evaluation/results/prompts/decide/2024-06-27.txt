As of June 27, 2024, Amazon's stock has reached a significant milestone, surpassing a $2 trillion market cap for the first time, driven by a nearly 4% gain in a single day. Analysts suggest that the market's concentration on major tech companies like Amazon may continue, with a lack of large catalysts to broaden market participation.

Amazon is also making strategic moves in the e-commerce space, preparing to launch a new platform to compete with discount retailers like Temu and Shein.

Tesla is currently in the spotlight due to a court case concerning CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which shareholders voted to reinstate despite a previous ruling that voided it. The company argues that the shareholder vote should resolve the legal debate over Musk's compensation. Additionally, Tesla's quality rankings have declined, with a recent survey showing it falling behind competitors like GM and Ford. Design changes in Tesla vehicles, such as the removal of turn-signal stalks, have frustrated owners and contributed to this decline in quality.

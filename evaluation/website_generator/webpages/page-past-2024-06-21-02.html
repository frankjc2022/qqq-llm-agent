Some on Wall Street have begun to question whether the stock can continue its historic rally. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) has reclaimed its title as the most valuable US company in market capitalization. Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into the performance of the Big Tech stocks and explain what investors should consider for their portfolios. "We think that mega-caps drove the first leg of this upturn this year. And as we get into the second half, we think the upturn will broaden to mid-cap stocks. So that's where we are really looking most for opportunities. We still like Nvidia. We still see a lot of upside, but we don't think it's going to be as outsized of a performer compared to the rest of our portfolio," Delevska explains. She adds that cybersecurity is a "particularly exciting" sector because the fundamentals are improving "by the day." Demand is high given the volume of cyber attacks affecting large companies on a daily basis, Delevska notes.

The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened mixed in Friday's session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading gains early in the trading day. Nvidia's (NVDA) reign as the US's most valuable publicly traded company was brief. The semiconductor giant shed $118 billion in market capitalization, allowing Microsoft (MSFT) to reclaim the top spot. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead emphasizes that Nvidia's continued dominance hinges on sustained enterprise demand for its offerings. If customers stop buying Nvidia's offerings, he warns, "then this whole gravy train comes to a screeching halt." Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global market strategist Scott Wren notes that while the computer services and technology sectors are currently "very highly valued, very momentum driven," investors should consider trimming some of their gains in these areas and reallocating into sectors like industrials, energy, and healthcare. The pharmaceutical and biotech sectors are making major moves as Sarepta (SRPT) received expanded approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its muscular dystrophy drug, and Gilead (GILD) saw encouraging results from its twice-yearly shot to prevent HIV. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer has upgraded Nike (NKE) from Perform to Outperform and raised its price target from $110 to $120. Meta (META) also received a bullish call, as KeyBanc raised its price target from $475 to $540, citing sustained advertising momentum. Keybanc Managing Director Justin Patterson explains that Meta's ad revenue is "accelerating sequentially" despite intensifying competition, indicating that "demand for Meta's advertisements remains very high."

Trump called out India's high duty on cars during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the U.S. last week, but agreed to work towards an early trade deal and resolve their standoff over tariffs.  Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has long criticised India for having import tariffs of around 100% on EVs which protect local automakers such as Tata Motors in the world's third largest auto market, where EV adoption is still at a nascent stage.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Charged: Tesla braces for delay in China autonomous driving license</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2025-02-19 15:55:32+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Institutional investors and professional traders rely on The Fly to keep up-to-the-second on breaking news in the electric vehicle and clean energy space, as well as which stocks in these sectors that the best analysts on Wall Street are saying to buy and sell.

Lopez Research founder Maribel Lopez joins Morning Brief to highlight this as a starting point for negotiations, emphasizing that the actual tariff rate is yet to be determined. "This is really an opening volley by Trump to say he's really serious about tariffs. Tariffs will happen. The amount of the tariff and what the negotiation standpoint is still unknown," Lopez explains.She highlights that industries like the automotive sector, with a strong US presence, may have a better chance of negotiating exemptions. "The call to action for everybody right now is to try to figure out what they can do to make a play to say that they're going to invest in America — to either create manufacturing jobs, to create investment in some other type of category that we would consider as beneficial to the economy," Lopez explains.While acknowledging the seriousness of tariffs, Lopez reassures that the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) is not overreacting yet as the Trump administration continues to negotiate with international officials.

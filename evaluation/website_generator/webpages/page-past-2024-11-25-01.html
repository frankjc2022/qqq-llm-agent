Thanks to personal achievements and the success of his company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), Buffett has even become known as the "Oracle of Omaha."  With a track record of decades of market-beating returns, it's no surprise that investors of all experience levels (myself included) turn to Buffett's words and Berkshire Hathaway's holdings for guidance on how to approach the market.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Dow Jones Futures Fall: Nvidia Stock Tumbles To Key Level; Fed Inflation Data Looms</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-11-25 22:48:21+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Dow Jones Futures Fall: Nvidia Stock Tumbles To Key Level; Fed Inflation Data Looms</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>What the CHIPS Act, grants could look like under new Trump admin.</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-11-25 21:43:13+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>As the Biden administration attempts to hand out and adjust CHIPS & Science Act funding to chipmakers, what is the commentary from President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration around boosting domestic semiconductor production? Notably, the US is reportedly cutting Intel's (INTC) $8.5 billion chipmaking grant to below $8 billion as officials try to balance that with the $3.5 billion grant the company was awarded from the Pentagon. "It's worth remembering that it was the first Trump administration that devised the concept of trying to incentivize firms to build more in the US, the CHIPS act was first discussed in Congress under the Trump administration, the first investment of TSMC (TSM) — the Taiwanese company in Arizona — was announced under the first Trump administration," Tufts University professor of International History Christopher Miller tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton. "And so I wouldn't be surprised to see some small changes to the program. Specific grants might be amended, but the basic framework of trying to use financial incentives to get more chips made domestically, that's an idea the first Trump administration more or less came up with."

CNET Editor-at-Large Bridget Carey joins Wealth! to share insights on the best savings strategies for Apple (AAPL) products. Carey highlights several noteworthy deals, particularly the redesigned 10th-generation iPad now available for around $280. However, she cautions consumers to be strategic, advising them to ensure they're getting products that are not too old because "you're looking at longevity being the issue." Carey outlines attractive deals across multiple Apple product lines, including MacBooks, AirPod Pro 2's, and Apple Watches. Carey points out an especially appealing aspect of these promotions: many older models remain viable options — especially since new health-related features with these techs will still be usable on older models.

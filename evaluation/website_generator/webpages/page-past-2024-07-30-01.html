The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman joins Market Domination to share his perspective. Newman describes the AI trend as "a blockbuster moment." He emphasizes that companies must invest heavily in AI for research, infrastructure, and more, warning that "they are going to get it wrong" if they don't. He stresses the importance of companies not underinvesting and missing "this trend line." However, Newman acknowledges there will be "a digestion period" before the benefits of these investments materialize. "We're at this really important inflection," Newman tells Yahoo Finance. "We're at this point where people are still a little uncertain what it means. You have all these knowledge workers where work is being done for them. They're a little uncertain what it means for their future, for their jobs." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Rockland Trust chief investment officer David Smith joins Catalysts to share his outlook on tech stocks. Smith notes, "It's a data-intensive point in the season," with earnings reports and Federal Reserve decisions all scheduled for this week. However, following lackluster reports from companies like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) last week, Smith observes that "there's very little appetite for companies that miss earnings," especially in the technology sector, which explains the massive sell-offs markets have seen. Regarding AI investments by Big Tech companies, Smith explains to Yahoo Finance, "I think... AI is important to all of the Magnificent 7 in different ways, so to paint them all with the same brush is a little bit risky."

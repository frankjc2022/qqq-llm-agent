But not everyone is bullish on Tesla. Bireme Capital Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer Evan Tindell joins Catalysts to talk about why he has taken a short position on the electric vehicle pioneer. "We could easily see Tesla dropping 50%," he explains, citing the loss of market share as electric vehicle competition heats up among auto manufacturers. He also points to self-driving capabilities and robotaxi promises that continue to be pushed off by CEO Elon Musk have soured his outlook on Tesla stock.

To dissect the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on earnings, Market Domination Overtime welcomes The Transcript Editor and Founder of Avondale Asset Management Scott Krisiloff. Krisiloff acknowledges the first quarter earnings season has been stronger than expected, with consumers demonstrating resilience in the face of economic headwinds. However, a major theme that has emerged throughout the earnings reports is the crucial role of AI. Krisiloff notes that the tech companies with significant AI plays "are in one bucket," while the rest of the Fortune 500 corporations "very interested" in AI's potential to drive business growth and enhance their operations. He also notes how companies discussed how power-hungry AI systems are. "I think what we're seeing with AI is that it's this massive tool that's being built for humanity that has the potential to multiply economic output to levels that we haven't seen before, but, in order to do that, it's very energy-intensive," Krisiloff explains.

The qualification clears a major hurdle for the world's biggest memory chipmaker which has been struggling to catch up with local rival SK Hynix in the race to supply the advanced memory chips capable of handling generative AI work.  Samsung and Nvidia have yet to sign a supply deal for the approved eight-layer HBM3E chips but will do so soon, the sources said, adding that they expect supplies would start by the fourth quarter of 2024.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Recession outlook, tech trade, Zoetis CFO: Market Domination</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-08-06 22:04:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>US equities (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are holding on tightly to Tuesday gains in their recovery from the widespread sell-off that kicked off the trading week.

While some on Wall Street are concerned about a recession, wondering if the Federal Reserve waited too long to make cuts, others may seem this as a buying opportunity. Wedbush Securities Managing Director, senior equity research analyst Dan Ives joins Market Domination to discuss the recent sell-off in tech and what investors need to know if they plan on buying the dip. Ives tells investors, "For Big Tech, these are the buying opportunities... these global sort of white-knuckle moments, you buy high quality, large-cap tech" Ives adds later, "Look at the fundamentals. I mean, we just came through a tech earnings season that was actually pretty robust relative to, I think, Big Tech, cloud, and AI. Look at Palantir (PLTR) last night, just another, you know, monster performance. So we're kind of looking at what are the fundamentals look like. Here in Asia, we don't see any issues in terms of demand and I think we hear this from Nvidia (NVDA) in the next few weeks. These are the opportunities if you're a believer like we are."

Wall Street was rocked on Monday as US equities (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC) were in a free fall, finding some relief and eventually staging a bounce back on Tuesday. Part of those declines is due in part to issues with the Bank of Japan raising its interest rates. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is also bouncing back after a large drop in value, currently sitting above $50,000. Yahoo Finance Reporter Jared Blikre breaks down the top takeaways for the trading day on Tuesday, August 6. KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst Jackson Ader joins Asking For A Trend to give insight into the tech sector, how its performing, and what investors need to know. In terms of a chief concern this earnings season for Big Tech CapEx spending, Ader relates back to Microsoft (MSFT) and its recent earnings: "What Microsoft said was, hey, we're actually a little bit more flexible than maybe you realize only half of our CapEx really goes into those fixed long term, 15, 20 year assets. And the other half is kits and GPUs. Maybe they're going to be GPUs, maybe they're going to be CPUs, maybe they're going to be in-house chips, but the focus on flexibility in artificial intelligence, I think is going to be a really good one, and key for the industry..." The S&P 500 recovered some of its sell-off losses, closing Tuesday's session 1.03% higher. While the widespread selling activity erased a sizable chunk of the Magnificent Seven's market cap, is this pattern of peak-to-trough declines really unprecedented for the index? Julie Hyman breaks down Goldman Sachs charts illustrating the S&P 500's history of sell-offs and ability to bounce back from similar pullbacks. Oil markets (CL=F, BZ=F) are experiencing a rebound along the broader market and as tensions rise in the Middle East. Sankey Research president and lead analyst Paul Sankey explains, "This latest issue that we're facing between Israel and Iran is not in itself even a new twist to the plot. And in that regard, if you think back to, say, 2019, when Iranian proxies attacked Saudi Arabia and knocked out 7 million barrels a day of capacity, or when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, I'm sad to say that the current environment is not very scary for oil supply interruptions. I will say that the markets are quite scary. So the financial markets are really driving oil right now." Lastly, a slew of companies released their latest quarterly reports after the market close.

KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst Jackson Ader joins Asking For A Trend to give insight into the tech sector, how its performing, and what investors need to know. In terms of a chief concern this earnings season for tech, capex spending, Ader relates back to Microsoft (MSFT) and its recent earnings: "What Microsoft said was, 'hey, we're actually a little bit more flexible than maybe you realize.

However, despite being China’s first profit-making new energy vehicle (NEV) maker, the stock has tumbled on slowing growth. I’m still bullish, noting the company’s strong balance sheet and attractive metrics, but I’m increasingly wary about competition and anecdotal evidence about build quality.

Tesla said in a court filing that a Delaware judge should recognize a vote by Tesla shareholders in favor of the pay package and reverse her January ruling that voided the compensation.  In response, shareholder attorneys said the vote to ratify Musk's pay has no legal effect and the only way for Tesla to challenge the January ruling is to appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Apple's OpenAI Deal Requires In-House Innovation To Boost Growth</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-06-21 16:01:03+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Despite the potential in AI, management has not indicated enough critical innovation strategy to make results certain.

The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened mixed in Friday's session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading gains early in the trading day. Nvidia's (NVDA) reign as the US's most valuable publicly traded company was brief. The semiconductor giant shed $118 billion in market capitalization, allowing Microsoft (MSFT) to reclaim the top spot. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead emphasizes that Nvidia's continued dominance hinges on sustained enterprise demand for its offerings. If customers stop buying Nvidia's offerings, he warns, "then this whole gravy train comes to a screeching halt." Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global market strategist Scott Wren notes that while the computer services and technology sectors are currently "very highly valued, very momentum driven," investors should consider trimming some of their gains in these areas and reallocating into sectors like industrials, energy, and healthcare. The pharmaceutical and biotech sectors are making major moves as Sarepta (SRPT) received expanded approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its muscular dystrophy drug, and Gilead (GILD) saw encouraging results from its twice-yearly shot to prevent HIV. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer has upgraded Nike (NKE) from Perform to Outperform and raised its price target from $110 to $120. Meta (META) also received a bullish call, as KeyBanc raised its price target from $475 to $540, citing sustained advertising momentum. Keybanc Managing Director Justin Patterson explains that Meta's ad revenue is "accelerating sequentially" despite intensifying competition, indicating that "demand for Meta's advertisements remains very high."

Justin Patterson, Keybanc managing director, has lifted his price target on Meta to $540 from $475, citing sustained advertising momentum. Patterson joins the Morning Brief to discuss his outlook on the tech giant. Patterson highlights that Meta's ad revenue is "accelerating sequentially" despite intensifying competition, indicating that "demand for Meta's advertisements remains very high." He notes that advertisers are willing to bid at higher rates to reach Meta's user base, emphasizing that "the returns for this AI advertising cycle are still very strong." Beyond advertising, Patterson points out Meta's broader AI benefits. He observes increased engagement across Meta's platforms due to AI investments, as well as ad-tech refinement boosting returns for advertisers. These factors, he argues, are contributing to Meta's overall gains in the market. Furthermore, with TikTok facing a potential ban, Patterson suggests that Meta's platforms could attract users needing to reallocate their social media time.

Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Director & Global Head of Technical Strategy Mark Newton joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss major market trends forming around the tech-heavy S&P 500 and the Federal Reserve's interest rate narrative. Newton believes there are "a lot of reasons to be constructive about the market," going on to explain: "We're heading into a very bullish time of seasonality in election years. July tends to be very, very good, similar to June. I think a lot of investors remain worried about geopolitical risk, about political risk and the fear of growth slowdowns. But the bottom line is, technically, we have over 70% of all Russell 3000 (^RUA) stocks above their 200-day moving averages. That's actually a much healthier sign." He also anticipates rates will fall along with the dollar: "I do sense that the data is going to continue to get weaker along the fringes. Inflation should start to fall like a rock. So despite the fact that gas (RB=F) and food prices are high for everybody, you have been seeing some evidence of broad-based inflation starting to come down. And I think that's going to be encouraging, not because a weak economy means stocks are good, more that the Fed's rate cut view will come back into line. And we'll have a little bit more clarity as to when they start cutting rates."

It forces companies to work hard on unique values and products that offer solutions where their competitors fail. With Nvidia's (NVDA) rapid AI domination, it leaves one to wonder how Amazon (AMZN) will carve a space in this market. On Opening Bid with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, Neuberger Berman senior research analyst Daniel Flax shares that the key for Amazon is 'bringing a level of differentiation,' both internally and through partnerships, like with Nvidia, Intel (INTC), and AMD (AMD).  For full episodes of Opening Bid, watch on our website or listen on your favorite podcast platform.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Nvidia Stock Is Still Falling as Shareholder Meeting Concludes</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-06-26 17:08:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>At a quick annual meeting, Nvidia shareholders approved all 12 recommended nominees to the company’s board.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>The S&P 500 and Nvidia, Chipotle stock split: Morning Brief</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-06-26 16:55:26+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>It's the middle of the week, but stocks aren't slowing down.

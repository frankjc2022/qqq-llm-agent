Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination to discuss Amazon's upcoming earnings and why investors should pay attention to how Amazon Web Services performs. On what to expect with AWS, Bajarin states: "Everybody is going to be looking at cloud growth for AWS. Right now, it's super trendy to talk about CapEx, everyone wants to see what the hyperscalers are spending in terms of new infrastructure, buying AI servers, creating 'AI factories,' as Nvidia (NVDA) likes to call them. I think that's what's going to be a big spotlight, what Amazon's growth is doing in terms of AWS. I think it's probably predictable it will be healthy, somewhat double-digit. Where are they going, where are they guiding, and what CapEx are they investing?" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Wall Street expects 78 cents in EPS and $133.1 billion in revenues as the company reports after market hours. Amazon stock has been buoyed by the company’s strong positioning in AI, cloud computing, and e-commerce.

Some of the reports announced plans for major capital expenditures toward the development of AI projects. Niles Investment Management Founder Dan Niles joins Catalysts to explore how tech giants benefit from each other's earnings reports, as well as the market's reaction to tech earnings. "Meta came out first, and they guided below the Street for next quarter's revenues, but then they took up their cap-x as well as their expenses. Google came out after that, and remember, Meta went down 11%, and Google initiated a dividend, which was great, but if you look at the forward numbers, actually, the estimates across the Street actually edged down for revenues for their upcoming June quarter as well. So, I think to some extent, Google benefitted from Meta going first, and if you look at Microsoft, sort of a similar situation, where the stock was up, I think, 2% or so the next day, but again, they came after Meta, and Microsoft's forward revenue numbers edged down slightly as well," Niles explained.

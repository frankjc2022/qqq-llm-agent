Who would benefit most from its ban?</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2025-01-03 23:10:00+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>TikTok is still a key platform for advertisers, ranking second in traffic after Meta's Facebook and Instagram (META) according to MikMak.  With the deadline approaching for TikTok parent ByteDance to divest from the platform or face a US ban, MikMak founder and CEO Rachel Tipograph comes on Asking for a Trend to highlight TikTok’s greatest strengths in attracting users and building community. She notes the popular social media app's 200% year-over-year growth in traffic. "It captures your attention with the content and the algorithm, and through personalization, it drives you through the funnel to get you to convert," Tipograph says. "So it's the power of the entire marketing funnel that exists within TikTok. You find some of that in Meta, you find some of that in Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) but TikTok is the whole story." Tipograph notes if the Chinese-owned app is banned, Alphabet could see the biggest gains in ad revenue, while e-commerce platforms like Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), and Walmart (WMT) could benefit from TikTok Shops' potential loss.

As the holiday shopping season quickly approaches, JCPenney CEO Marc Rosen discusses the company's turnaround plan as it announced over a year ago a $1 billion self-funded reinvestment in the business. Rosen explains that JCPenney has zeroed in on its marketing, kicking off its brand platform Make It Count and reintroducing its rewards program. He notes that the rewards program has put roughly $500,000,000 "back into the pockets of consumers." He is confident that with the program in place, JCPenney could see about twice as many customers receiving rewards than in 2023, which will ultimately drive more sales during the 2024 holiday shopping season.

Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton monitor these market moves in Friday's final trading hour in this episode of Market Domination. Microsoft corporate vice president and deputy CISO Ann Johnson comes onto the program to explain how and why these outages occurred, believing it to be linked to "something that was unexpected" and beyond CrowdStrike's control. Baird managing director and market strategist Michael Antonelli talks about whether markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) still have room to grow as investors move out of Big Tech and eye the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 election and Federal Reserve interest rate cuts: "I want everybody to remember the US economy is not an on-off switch. It's a dimmer... It grows brighter, grows darker. That's how it works."

All around the globe, companies have faced technology troubles after an update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (CRWD) impacted Microsoft (MSFT) systems. It led to delayed and canceled flights, stores closing their doors for the day, and headaches for millions. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz posted on X the outage wasn't caused by a cyberattack and that a fix had been deployed. Many believe it could take a few days for all systems to be fully back online.  Microsoft corporate vice president and deputy CISO Ann Johnson tells Market Domination about what went wrong. Johnson used the analogy of updating an app on your smartphone overnight. That's basically what CrowdStrike did; they issued an update overnight, and that update ended up roiling systems. Johnson explains that Microsoft is working with CrowdStrike to help those customers who were impacted by the update, adding that Microsoft has engineers working to help businesses implement the fix.  Johnson says it's hard to say how long it will take for all issues to be fully resolved, but ultimately believes CrowdStrike likely did test the update thoroughly and that the problem was "something that was unexpected."  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Global issues arose after CrowdStrike updated software in Microsoft Windows (MSFT) systems. Citizens JMP Securities equity research analyst Trevor Walsh joins Market Domination to give insight into the incident with CrowdStrike and what it means for company and those in the cyber security sector moving forward. Walsh argues this incident won't really affect CrowdStrike's overall health ahead of its next earnings release on September 4, reducing it to "one-off basis" rather than a broader risk to the cybersecurity firm. "The criticality of CrowdStrike as a security platform tends to, I think, outweigh some of those issues in the sense of customers can't afford to just turn them off and not renew because of one incident. They're just too tied into the ecosystem," Walsh tells Yahoo Finance. "They're too critical of a tool and what kind of within the overall stack. So I think those conversations certainly have the potential to emerge..." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban joins Market Domination to discuss Chkaiban notes that while Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday had "boring" moments, "it was exciting because we thought it articulated very well the promise of generative AI at the core of the operating system." However, he doubts whether the technology alone can spark a product cycle, explaining, "we're not really convinced that on-device AI will enable game-changing user experiences because the hardware simply is not game-changing... since GPT-4 is anyway available readily on most iPhones through the ChatGPT app, the question is, do users really need to upgrade to use that technology? The answer so far is not really." Regardless, he believes the stock is "fairly valued," especially as services are at an all-time high.

Tesla is in the spotlight as shareholders prepare to vote on CEO Elon Musk's controversial $56 billion compensation package, which has drawn significant attention due to its unprecedented size compared to other corporate pay structures. The company is also facing challenges, including a legal dispute regarding a $5.6 billion fee request related to a lawsuit that voided Musk's pay package.

Meta Platforms is also making headlines with its efforts to integrate AI tools into its services, particularly WhatsApp, to enhance business interactions. The company is recovering from a challenging earnings period and is focusing on new features like "Communities" on Messenger, aimed at improving organizational communication. Furthermore, Meta is facing regulatory scrutiny regarding its algorithms and their impact on youth, as new legislation in New York seeks to limit exposure to addictive content for minors.

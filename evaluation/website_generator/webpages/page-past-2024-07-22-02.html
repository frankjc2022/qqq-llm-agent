The company's shares are trading higher Monday afternoon following this report. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief strategist Patrick Moorhead joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss his outlook on the semiconductor giant. Moorhead states he is "not surprised" by this move, noting that "it makes sense" for Nvidia. He explains that since full-spec Nvidia chips are "easy to pull in" and import into China, the Department of Commerce is likely seeking a "not full-spec" alternative that the Chinese military couldn't use. Addressing the recent rebound of semiconductor stocks after political pressures, Moorhead observes that "regardless of what administration" takes office as a result of the 2024 election, "there is going to be a reaction." However, with China being a leading exporter of chips to the US, he believes investors are realizing that companies like Nvidia will see increased sales. "This whole notion of AI coming to a screeching halt anytime soon is fiction," he tells Yahoo Finance.

San Jose State Professor Ahmed Banafa explains that the outage affected many more people than a typical IT failure impacting just one company. He notes that the reason it's taking so long to fix the issue is because it requires manually deleting the file that created the chaos from thousands of computers, a process that could take weeks. With systems compromised, hackers can take advantage of this situation by creating phishing emails along with fake research and websites to gain access to affected parties. When asked how individuals could keep their computers safe, Banafa emphasized thinking before clicking and only using help directly from Microsoft and CrowdStrike. In addition, Banafa notes that no one questions a software update, and as a result, 8.5 million devices suffered this outage. He thinks that the incident may prompt Microsoft to reconsider its relationship with CrowdStrike due to the negative publicity.

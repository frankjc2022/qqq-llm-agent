With no large catalysts, the market can maintain this pattern for some time, data suggests. Still, there are other stocks and sectors to watch, as Yahoo Finance reporter Jared Blikre joins Asking For A Trend to explain.

"Until we see some sort of broadening in earnings, it's unlikely you're going to see some sort of broadening in the market. And absent some kind of major market macro catalyst, you're not going to have that happen. And just, as a sort of footnote to that, a market catalyst that's a big sort of major macro driver of stocks is also going to be a uniform condition for the growth names and for the tech names, just like it hurt them in 2022," Yadava tells Yahoo Finance.

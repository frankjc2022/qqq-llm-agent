To dissect the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on earnings, Market Domination Overtime welcomes The Transcript Editor and Founder of Avondale Asset Management Scott Krisiloff. Krisiloff acknowledges the first quarter earnings season has been stronger than expected, with consumers demonstrating resilience in the face of economic headwinds. However, a major theme that has emerged throughout the earnings reports is the crucial role of AI.

He also notes how companies discussed how power-hungry AI systems are. "I think what we're seeing with AI is that it's this massive tool that's being built for humanity that has the potential to multiply economic output to levels that we haven't seen before, but, in order to do that, it's very energy-intensive," Krisiloff explains.

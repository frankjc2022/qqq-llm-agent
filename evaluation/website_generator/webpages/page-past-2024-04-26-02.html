Bahnsen discusses the problem with investors relying on high valuations as a standard: "High volatility is a byproduct of a high multiple that is totally disconnected from reality. So expensive stocks get more expensive until they don't. But it's impossible to gauge, judge, and certainly time. But you saw already this year earnings season, Facebook just getting ripped apart yesterday and yet Google rallying today. The Mag Seven is over. It doesn't exist as a monolith anymore.

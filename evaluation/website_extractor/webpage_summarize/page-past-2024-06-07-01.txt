The text provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the tech sector, particularly focusing on major companies like Apple and Nvidia, as well as broader market trends. 

The May Jobs Report indicates stronger-than-expected payroll gains, which has implications for Federal Reserve interest rate policies. The report shows a slowing job creation trend, with job openings exceeding the number of unemployed individuals, suggesting a shift towards full employment. This has led to speculation about the Fed's future actions, with a hawkish stance likely to persist, potentially impacting the S&P 500 and overall market sentiment.

Nvidia recently executed a significant 10-for-1 stock split, reflecting its impressive market valuation, which briefly surpassed $3 trillion. Analysts highlight Nvidia's dominant position in the AI sector, suggesting it has an "insurmountable lead" in this rapidly growing field. Meanwhile, Apple is gearing up for its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where it will unveil its AI strategy, a critical focus for investors. The upcoming week is expected to be pivotal, with major tech earnings from companies like Oracle, Broadcom, and Adobe, alongside significant events such as the Tesla shareholder vote and the Fed's monetary policy announcement.

Overall, the tech market is experiencing a bullish trend, driven by optimism surrounding AI advancements and strong earnings reports. The interplay between job growth, inflation concerns, and central bank policies will continue to shape investor sentiment and market dynamics in the near future.

Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist Lou Basenese joins Yahoo Finance in-studio to talk about tech stock leaders with broadening use cases for artificial intelligence, highlighting Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) "You have to play a basket. You're not going to be able to pick a single horse in this AI race and work out as well as it did for Nvidia (NVDA) last year," Basenese says. "Let's just face it, Nvidia can't have the same run... this year as it did last year. It just would become too big of a company."

The group, which previously consisted of seven leading technology companies, has now dwindled to the "Magnificent Four." Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) continue to spearhead gains, while Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have underperformed compared to their peers.

Many of the big names in tech — Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — have been grouped together and referred to as The Magnificent Seven, but some, like Apple and Tesla, have fallen off from great heights. Now, investors are chattering over whether or not tech can weather any potential storms in the market. TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to break down the recent movements in the tech sector and how its major players can operate moving forward. O'Donnell talks about potential leaders in tech for the long-term: "The one thing is, Nvidia's got 90% share. Anybody who's got 90% share is going to lose a little share. But, that doesn't mean they still can't grow organically from where they are. You're just going to see a lot more competitors. If we look at it collectively, I still think there is several years of growth in the collective semiconductor market for AI-powered stuff. So, you're going to see, as I said, I talked about AMD (AMD). Intel (INTC) will be interesting to see."

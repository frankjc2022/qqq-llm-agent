Thill breaks down the situation with the tech giants' AI efforts: "Microsoft told you a year ago that it would be the fastest business to $10 billion. They haven't said a peep about hitting that target. Microsoft is going to be a $250 billion dollar-plus company. That means it's a low single digit percent of their total revenue. Amazon (AMZN), they don't even break out the number. Google (GOOG, GOOGL), how is the AI product going? Well, there's no financial impact right now. Like, so Salesforce (CRM), they're not selling AI. Adobe (ADBE) it's tiny... it's tiny for everyone. " He brings it back to Snowflake's (SNOW) current situation: "It's not like this is Snowflake losing and everyone else is winning. No one's winning in software in AI because it's so early. There's no revenue, but there will be. And so the point is, do you want to invest?"

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that had dismissed the lawsuit, which accuses Amazon of harming competition through restrictions on its suppliers and third-party sellers on Amazon.com.  Amazon is currently seeking dismissal of another case involving similar claims by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and more than a dozen states.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Amazon offers grocery delivery discount for annual subscribers</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-08-22 15:58:17+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Whole Foods owner also expands program for all Prime Access members</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>How AI investments are shaping the tech sector's future</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-08-22 15:15:40+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Nvidia's (NVDA) stock continues to rally ahead of its highly anticipated quarterly earnings report on August 28th. To discuss the potential impact of the semiconductor giant's results on the broader tech sector (XLK), Bernstein Internet Equity Research Analyst Mark Shmulik joins Morning Brief. Shmulik notes that when it comes to the AI trade, tech giants have made it clear that "the risk of underinvesting is much higher than the risk of overinvesting." He believes that "so long as that momentum continues," the entire tech sector stands to benefit. Regarding tech valuations, Shmulik observes they have cooled and "are not demanding." However, he emphasizes that companies must "deliver on the core business ahead of you today" to fund their ongoing AI investments. Notably, with companies like Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) beginning to see returns on their AI investments, Shmulik points out that "it's no longer talk of a theoretical, it's actually showing up in the numbers." When it comes to investment opportunities in the AI space, Shmulik highlights Meta (META) as "one of the cleaner names" for those looking to participate in the AI trade.

Following its market debut, Reddit (RDDT) outperformed expectations after positioning itself as an AI play. Bedrock Founder & Managing Partner Geoff Lewis joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into how AI is disrupting various sectors in the market. Lewis focuses particularly on OpenAI and its possible future maneuvers. He compares the company's current legal situation to the "early days of Facebook" (META): "Facebook had a lot of lawsuits as well. I say bring on the lawsuits with respect to OpenAI. I think that's a strong bull signal. The reality is this is a company that's really only been monetizing for just over a year, predominantly with consumers. They've only recently launched offerings to enterprises. It's been publicly reported they're north of a $2 billion revenue run rate. I don't think we've ever seen either in the private markets a revenue ramp that's been this rapid."

Constellation Research Founder and Principal Analyst R "Ray" Wang joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what investors are expected to hear from the tech giant at its annual event. Wang notes that with Apple's extensive involvement in artificial intelligence, investors are eager to see how the company plans to incorporate AI into iPhones, stating, "it hasn't always been explicit." He mentions that with upcoming iOS upgrades across Apple's product lines, investors will be looking to understand how AI will "bring Apple devices to life." Wang emphasizes the importance of collaborations, suggesting that a potential partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) could be in the works. He believes it's crucial for Apple to demonstrate that "they are part of that ecosystem." Wang views this potential deal as "one step towards the integration" of AI more prominently at Apple. However, he believes that as time goes on, investors will see "more partnerships emerge" as AI integration develops further.

Sixteen US attorneys general are joining the DOJ suit alleging Apple's practice of creating a monopoly in the smartphone and digital app store markets. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin — who is among the state attorneys general pushing for this case — breaks down the consumer harm Apple's anticompetitive methods have done: "What we lay out is a pattern that Apple has engaged in of using its market share to restrict and exclude business practices in a way that stifles innovation and makes it harder for consumers to leave the iPhone platform. And as a result of that, it has driven up significantly its own profits and the cost of the products to consumers, so that now in 2024, people are paying over $1,500 for an iPhone, that if you adjust the 2007 price of an iPhone for inflation, it would only be $450."

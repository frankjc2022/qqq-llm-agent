The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) reversed course from its Monday gains, closing Tuesday's session lower by over 290 points. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared by 220 points. Federal Reserve leaders spoke on Tuesday, outlining their thoughts on the current state of the economy. Pence Capital Management chief investment officer Dryden Pence signals the potential for one interest rate cut at the end of the year, explaining, "[The Fed] would like to pivot, but I think it continues to move to the right because you have this tremendous robustness of the American economy. I think what people have forgotten is we've added so many workers; we've added 6.1 million new people working in this country since the height of pre-pandemic. When you think about that, that's like adding the entire labor force of Illinois, and that's like adding the entire GDP of France, which is the seventh largest country in the world. And so we've grown France in the last four years." FedEx (FDX) reported fourth quarter earnings that topped Wall Street expectations. The shipping giant reported adjusted earnings of $5.41 per share compared to the estimated $5.34. Pence points to a reacceleration in e-commerce and improved margins as tailwinds for the company. On the autos front, shares of Rivian (RIVN) jumped after Volkswagen (VWAGY, VOW.DE) announced it would invest up to $5 billion as part of a joint venture. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) is under pressure after announcing its fourth recall of the Cybertruck.

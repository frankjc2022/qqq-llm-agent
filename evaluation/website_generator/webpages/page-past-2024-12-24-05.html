"One of the, I think, good pieces of news is that President-elect Trump has appointed a number of people from the tech world, venture capitalists, people with tech experience to prominent positions," Kovacevic says, noting that this is a "good sign" for the industry. He adds that Trump's second term will likely lead to a shift in the US government's attitude toward AI. The Biden administration's "main approach to artificial intelligence was to say, 'This is an area where we ought to tread carefully, put up guardrails, and focus on safety,'" Kovacevic says. "What I think you are going to see with Trump is a pivot from safety to really [seeing] AI as an economic asset for the United States, a national asset for the United States, where we should go out and beat other countries, particularly China in AI."

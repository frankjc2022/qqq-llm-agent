If Vice President Kamala Harris won the race against former President Donald Trump, Rosner makes the case for why it would have a positive effect for EV manufacturers like Tesla (TSLA) given the tax incentives provided to car buyers. “In the case of a Trump victory, I think this is where there's a potential risk for much more disruption” in the auto industry,” the analyst indicates since potential tariffs on vehicles imported from outside the US could benefit traditional American automakers like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). He notes that a second term for former president Donald Trump may not be as negative as previously thought since Trump is now "better friends" with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Rosner highlighted that his top stock picks for the industry are actually those in the peripheral auto space, including Autoliv (ALV), Aptiv (APTV), and TE Connectivity (TEL), rather than automakers themselves since the analyst remains cautious about the sector.

In addition to the huge amount of water, firefighters used an aircraft to drop fire retardant on the “immediate area” of the electric truck as a precautionary measure, the agency said in a preliminary report.  Firefighters said previously that the battery reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (540 Celsius) while it was in flames.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Proceed with caution in the auto industry, analyst says</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-09-12 21:59:10+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>After General Motors (GM) and Hyundai (HYMTF) announced a joint agreement to explore clean energy technologies and other automotive advancements, Wolfe Research managing director and senior research analyst Emmanuel Rosner joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he is cautious about the auto industry. “There are some real unprecedented structural challenges for the industry,” Rosner says, explaining that “megatrends” in the space, like electrification, autonomous driving, and software adoption, are “taking significantly longer to play out” than initially expected. “Automakers have been making massive investments” into these trends but are yet to see the payoff as monetization is “taking significantly longer.” Rosner notes that "massive market share shifts” also affect the auto industry as “there have been some winners in electrification,” namely Tesla (TSLA) and Chinese automakers. “The five Chinese OEMs and Tesla have essentially been winning," taking market share from traditional automakers. The analyst remains cautious about the auto industry at large, saying that given these “tremendous structural challenges.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

RBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst Brad Erickson joins Asking for a Trend to break down the state of the AI trade and the technology's outlook amid a heated competition. Erickson explains that generative AI platforms are emerging "right in front of us," pointing to software engineering efficiencies, customer support platforms, and marketing tools as examples. He also highlights sovereign AI, where countries are spending on the technology to use and access data that no one else has. He adds, "If you look at like the top four or five CapEx spenders on AI infrastructure, it's $200 billion and it's going up next year probably by more than 10%." He explains that investors are in a position where they have to put "blind faith" into AI players, knowing that it will pay off in the future. He tells Yahoo Finance, "From my perspective, like we're taking a little bit more of a measured approach, saying, 'Look, $200 billion. Think about what you need to do to maintain operating margins.' Pretty simple math of, like, are we really talking about $300, $400 billion of marginal revenue every single year? Those are big numbers." Erickson believes that competing AI tools from names like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and OpenAI will ultimately "end up looking a lot of the same kind of thing." He argues that distribution is a more important factor and will likely determine the level of success.

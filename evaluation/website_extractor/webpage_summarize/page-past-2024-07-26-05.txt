The Fed is anticipated to indicate upcoming rate cuts, with analysts projecting a strong earnings growth of 26.8% and a revenue increase of 13.7% for the "Magnificent 7" group of companies. This performance raises questions about its potential to uplift the market. Alphabet is reportedly taking an aggressive stance in the AI sector, while doubts about the profitability of generative AI models are surfacing, as they have yet to generate significant revenue outside of Nvidia.

The S&P 500 has experienced a decline for two consecutive weeks, influenced by major players like Tesla and Alphabet. Analysts expect a 16.9% EPS growth for Q2 2024, with tech sector revisions remaining positive. Recent stock movements indicate a sharp rise following the personal consumption expenditures price index report, which aligns with inflation expectations, leading to speculation about a Fed interest-rate cut in September.

Small-cap stocks are gaining traction after a prolonged period dominated by larger companies. Alphabet's stock is viewed as a premium asset with growth potential, despite recent fluctuations. The company is also exploring partnerships in the tech space, particularly following its collaboration with Meta on smart glasses.

In terms of financial performance, Alphabet's Q2 results showed a 31% growth in operating income, although concerns about free cash flow due to AI investments persist. Analysts are divided on Alphabet's valuation, with some suggesting it remains an attractive investment despite the challenges posed by AI spending. Overall, the market is closely monitoring these developments as companies prepare for upcoming earnings reports and potential shifts in economic policy.

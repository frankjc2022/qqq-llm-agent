The server was packed with Amazon's artificial intelligence chips that compete with those from market leader Nvidia, Amazon executive Rami Sinno said on Friday, during a visit to the lab.  Amazon is developing its own processors to limit its reliance on costly Nvidia chips - the so-called Nvidia tax - that power some of the artificial intelligence cloud business at its Amazon Web Services, the main growth driver.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Nvidia's Loss Of Support Puts 8 'Secrets' Of Selling In Focus.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to magnify the daily moves in the chipmaker's shares by as much as two times have been a popular vehicle for investors seeking to jump on the stock's meteoric rise this year, with total assets swelling to about $6.3 billion as of this week from only $342 million in December 2023, according to data from CFRA.  But while the stock's roughly 130% year-to-date rally has rewarded bullish bets, recent turbulence in tech shares could amp up the risk for traders seeking to profit from Nvidia's gyrations.</div></div><div class='news-item'><div class='news-title'>Chip stock sell-off opens door for long-term plays: Analyst</div><div class='news-date'>Published on: 2024-07-25 14:53:15+00:00</div><div class='news-description'>Chip stocks continue their sector-wide slide, following a tech sell-off triggered by disappointing reports from some Magnificent 7 companies.  Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Morning Brief to discuss the semiconductor industry's current state. Moorhead observes that due to the chip sector's strong momentum over the past year, "any hiccup, any rumor of something" can trigger a stock decline. He suggests this downturn presents an opportunity for investors to identify potential high-growth companies beyond industry giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Intel (INTC). Moorhead advises investors to "look at a mid-term and even... long-term approach of where those stocks are going or could go," highlighting companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM). Regarding industry trends, Moorhead notes that many companies are pivoting towards AI, often at the expense of other initiatives. "They want their IT groups to pivot to generative AI. And a lot of this is about FOMO, it's the fear of missing out," he explains. This shift in focus is creating a divide in the market: "That's why you see companies that aren't engaged in the generative AI wave are seeing very mixed results."

The latest news highlights significant developments in major tech companies, particularly Tesla and Meta Platforms. 

Tesla is currently facing shareholder votes on CEO Elon Musk's proposed pay package, valued at $46 billion. Musk has indicated that the resolutions regarding his compensation and the company's potential relocation of its legal headquarters to Texas are likely to pass. However, there is notable dissent among shareholders, with a poll indicating that 96% of over 400,000 respondents oppose the pay package. Critics, including investor Ross Gerber, argue that the board has mishandled the situation and that Musk's compensation detracts from Tesla's core mission of manufacturing electric vehicles. The results of the vote will be revealed at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting.

In the broader market context, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have reached record highs, buoyed by the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates amid cooling inflation. Notably, Oracle's stock has surged following a partnership with Google and OpenAI, while Broadcom has reported strong quarterly results, leading to a stock split and increased dividends.

Meanwhile, Meta Platforms is navigating challenges related to content creator retention and regulatory scrutiny. Analysts suggest that Meta's efforts to support creators may be costly, impacting its financial performance. Despite these challenges, some analysts maintain a positive outlook on Meta's stock, citing strong fundamentals and potential for growth driven by AI integration.

Overall, the tech sector is experiencing a mix of optimism and concern, with significant shareholder actions and market movements shaping the landscape.

Kenwell says retail investors are "optimistic" but "realistic" for the new year. "They're looking to gain more exposure to crypto in 2025. They're looking to gain more exposure to equities in 2025. But they're also looking to raise some cash here," he says, later adding: "I think they're being prudent, but also, you know, keeping one foot in at least is so they keep getting taking advantage of, you know, more gains to come in 2025 if that is the case." The analyst reports that the survey found retail investors to prefer the financials sector and big-cap tech, including Magnificent Seven names and other artificial intelligence (AI) plays.

"We think we're headed toward a period of rapid technological shifts. Historically, whenever that's happened, significant opportunities have been unlocked," Crowley explains. He believes AI's economic impact could rival that of the internet revolution. Crowley identifies "real-world AI" as the sector's next evolution, highlighting two key investment opportunities. First, he points to "entirely new product-category" companies like Tesla (TSLA), which is advancing autonomous driving technology. Second, he sees potential in established companies with "existing business lines," such as Amazon (AMZN), which can leverage AI to enhance operational efficiency. "We're kind of trying to move into the next phase here of where we see AI playing out," he tells Yahoo Finance.

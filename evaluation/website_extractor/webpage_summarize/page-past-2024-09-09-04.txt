Meta Platforms is also making strides, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence. The company is rolling out new AI tools in the EU and has entered into agreements for renewable energy projects, including geothermal power for its data centers. Despite regulatory challenges, Meta's AI initiatives are seen as a boost to its business model, particularly in light of changes in advertising dynamics.
